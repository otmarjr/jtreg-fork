# These tests run a set of 5 tests two of which create an open file
# that will cause problems for jtreg cleaning up after a test.
#
# However, they are primarily designed for a Windows environment
# where open files can be a problem during file cleanup before/after
# a test. On a non-Windows environment (i.e. Linux, Solaris) all
# the tests in the openfiles test suite pass.
# But, for now, these makefiles are not set up to run on Windows. 
# When the makefiles are upgraded to run on Windows, the rules in this
# makefile will have to be updated (perhaps by using target-specific
# variable definitions) to behave correctly on Windows as well as
# non-Windows platforms.

#####
# In agentvm and othervm mode, jtreg should successfully run each test
# by moving to a new scratch directory when it can't clear the previous one.
