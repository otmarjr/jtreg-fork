<h1>3.5.
                                What is a <code>.jtr</code>
            file?</h1>
                
<p>As each test is run, it produces a JavaTest Results (<code>.jtr</code>)
                file which contains information about how the test was run, the name of the
                test, standard output, standard input, final status, etc.  The name of the file
                is the basename of the file containing the test description followed by the
                <code>.jtr</code> extension.  For example, <code>Hello.java</code> produces a
                file called <code>Hello.jtr</code>.  These files reside in the
                work directory which contains a directory hierarchy that
                parallels the source structure.</p>
