<h1>4.1.
                                What is the test root directory?
            </h1>
                
<p>The "test root directory", or "test suite root directory" is the
                root directory of the overall test suite.
                In OpenJDK terms, this means either of the "jdk/test/" or
                "langtools/test/" directories in an OpenJDK forest.</p>
                
<p>The "test root directory" for any test is determined by finding
                the smallest enclosing directory containing a marker file called
                TEST.ROOT.
                The TEST.ROOT file can also be used to define some global properties
                for the test suite.</p>
