<h1>3.8.
                                If a test fails, I'd like to put
            all of my debugging information into the final result.  How do I do
            that?</h1>
                
<p>The final result string is composed by the harness.  For tests that fail
                because an exception is thrown, the result string will contain some header
                string such as <code>`main' threw exception: </code> followed by the
                exception's type and detail message.  This detail message should contain
                sufficient information to provide the test user a starting point to investigate
                the unexpected failure.  It should <em>not</em> contain full debugging
                information.</p>

                
<p>The harness makes no guarantees as to the availability of any detail message
                longer than 128 characters.</p>
