<h1>2.15.
                                Can tests in different directories
            have the same name?</h1>
                
<p>Yes.  When a test is run by the harness, a special classloader is used so
                that the classpath is effectively set to include just the directory containing
                the test, plus the standard system classes.  Thus name
                clashes between tests in different directories are not a problem.</p>

                
<p>An alternative approach would be to associate a different package with each
                test directory.  This is done, for example, in the JCK test suite.  The
                difficulty with this idea is that in order to debug a test (under dbx or
                workshop or jdb or whatever) you must set up your classpath in just the right
                way.  This makes it difficult to diagnose bugs that are reported against
                specific tests.  </p>
