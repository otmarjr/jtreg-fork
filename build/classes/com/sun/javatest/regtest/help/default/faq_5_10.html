<h1>5.10.
                                Can I use <code>package</code>
            statements in my tests?</h1>
                
<p>Yes&hellip; but you probably don't want to.  The harness  searches for class
                files in a class directory with components which are parallel to the source
                directory.  It will be unable to locate packaged class files when the test is
                invoked via reflection.  Use of the <code>package</code> statement is not
                recommended unless the test is intended to test <code>package</code> statements.</p>

                
<p>Tests which test the package mechanism may use package statements; however,
                it will be the responsibility of the test writer to properly execute the
                compiled class as necessary.</p>
