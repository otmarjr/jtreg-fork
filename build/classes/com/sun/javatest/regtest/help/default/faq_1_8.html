<h1>1.8.
                                Why not use JUnit?</h1>
                
<p>JUnit was not around when we started writing tests for JDK.
                And, the test tag specification has been specifically designed for testing
                JDK, with support for testing applets, command-line interfaces,
                and so on, as well as simple API tests.</p>

                
<p>And by now, there are many thousands of tests written for jtreg,
                so it would not be practical to convert to JUnit.</p>
