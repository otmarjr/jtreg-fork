<h1>4.8.
                                How do I specify any libraries I want to use in TestNG tests?
            </h1>
                
<p>Tests using "@run testng" can use @library and @build in
                the standard way.
                For any test in a group of TestNG tests, you can specify the
                library by adding a line specifying the library in the
                TEST.properties file in the package root directory for the group of
                tests.
                </p>
                
<pre>lib.dirs = path-to-library ...</pre>
                
<p>As with the @library tag, if the path begins with "/",
                it will be evaluated relative to the test root directory;
                otherwise, it will be evaluated relative to the directory
                containing the TEST.properties file.
                </p>
                
<p>For any particular group of TestNG tests, you can only
                specify libraries for the entire group: you cannot specify one
                library for some of the tests and another library for other tests.
                This is because the all the source files in the group are
                compiled together.
                </p>
