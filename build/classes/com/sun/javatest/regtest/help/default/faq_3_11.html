<h1>3.11.
                                Can I generate reports for tests
            that have already been run?</h1>
                
<p>Yes!  The <code>-reportOnly</code> option to <code>jtreg</code> will
                generate the standard HTML reports for tests which have been previously
                executed.  Tests will <em>not</em> be executed.  A <a href="#question3.6">work
                directory</a> containing the results of the executed tests must be provided.
                The default location is <code>./JTwork</code>.  An alternate directory may be
                specified using <code>-workDir</code>.</p>
