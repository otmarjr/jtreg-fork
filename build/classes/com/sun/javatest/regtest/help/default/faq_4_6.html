<h1>4.6.
                                How do I identify a group of TestNG tests in their own directory?
            </h1>
                
<p>Add a line specifying the directory to TEST.ROOT</p>
                
<pre>TestNG.dirs = dir1 dir2 dir3 ...</pre>
                
<p>Include the package root directory for each group of TestNG
                tests, and specify the package root directory relative to the test
                root directory.
                </p>
                
<p>You can also override the value in TEST.ROOT by using the
                TEST.properties file in any subdirectory of the test root directory
                that contains the package root.
                If you put the declaration in a TEST.properties file, you can
                specify the path relative to the directory containing the
                TEST.properties file.
                In particular, instead of declaring the directory in TEST.ROOT,
                you could place the declaration in a TEST.properties file in the
                package root directory for the group of tests, in which case
                the declaration would be simply:
                </p>
                
<pre>TestNG.dirs = .</pre>
            
</body>
