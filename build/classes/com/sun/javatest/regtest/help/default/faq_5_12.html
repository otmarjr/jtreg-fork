<h1>5.12.
                                Should a test catch
            <code>Throwable</code>, <code>Exception</code>, or
            <code>Error</code>?</h1>
                
<p>Ideally, only specific, anticipated exceptions should be caught by a
                test.  Any other exception which is provoked during testing should be
                propagated back to the harness.</p>

                
<p>In the event that a very general exception is caught in test code, a certain
                amount of care will need to be exercised.  For example if a user wants to stop
                the harness during a test run, an <code>InterruptedException</code> is used to
                interrupt the test.  If that exception is caught by a test and not re-thrown to
                the harness, the stop request will be lost and the tests will not stop!</p>

                
<p>Here is a list of exceptions that may need to be re-thrown:</p>
                
<ul>
                    
<li>
<code>InterruptedException</code> (from <code>Exception</code>)</li>
                    
<li>
<code>InterruptedIOException</code> (from <code>IOException</code>)</li>
                    
<li>
<code>ThreadDeath</code> (from <code>Error</code>)</li>
                
</ul>
