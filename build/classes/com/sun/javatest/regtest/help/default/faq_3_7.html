                                What's the difference between the
            "fail" and "error" return status?</h1>
                
<p>If a test <em>failed</em>, then the harness was able to actually run the
                test code.  The failure could either indicate that the test truly failed
                (i.e. it threw an exception) or that there was some problem running the test
                due to security restrictions, lack of resources, etc.</p>

                
<p>If <em>error</em> is the final result of a test, then the harness was unable to
                run the test.  An error is most commonly associated with problems in the test
                description (typos, missing required arguments, etc.).</p>

                
<p>In either case the result contains a short message intended to provide hints
                    as to where the problem lies.
