<h1>5.18.
                                My test requires that I install my
            own security manager, but it appears that the JavaTest harness has already installed
            one. What do I do?</h1>
                
<p>The harness normally installs its own rather permissive security manager in
                self-defense to prevent tests from interfering with each other.  The harness'
                security manager is designed to prevent changes to the JVM's state that would
                impact other tests. Most tests will not find the standard harness security
                manager a hindrance.</p>

                
<p>A test which must install its own security manager will always need to run
                in its own separate JVM. To do this, add the <code>othervm</code> option to the
                <code>main</code> action in the test description.</p>
