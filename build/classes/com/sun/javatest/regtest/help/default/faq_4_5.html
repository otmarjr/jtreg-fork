<h1>4.5.
                                How does jtreg support TestNG tests?
            </h1>
                
<p>jtreg supports TestNG tests in two ways.</p>
                
<ol>
                    
<li>
<p>Tests can be written with a full test description
                     (the comment beginning /* @test....*/) and can use the following
                     action tag to run the test with TestNG: </p>
                            
<pre>"@run testng classname args"</pre>
                            
<p>Such a test would otherwise be similar to a standard test
                     using "@run main". You can use other tags such as @library and
                     @build, just as you would for "@run main".
                     These tests would normally be in the unnamed directory
                     (i.e. no package statement.)
                     These tests can be freely intermixed with other tests using
                     "@run main", "@run shell", "@run applet" and so on. </p> 
</li>
                    
<li>
<p>If you have a group of TestNG tests written in their own
                     package hierarchy, you can include that entire package
                     hierarchy as a subdirectory under the main test root directory.
                     If you do this, you must identify the root directory of that
                     package hierarchy to jtreg, so that it knows to treat all the
                     files in that package hierarchy specially.
                     In such a group of tests, you do not need to provide test
                     descriptions in each test.
                     You may optionally provide a test description if you choose to
                     do so, if you wish to specify information tags such as
                     @bug, @summary and @keyword.
                     You must not specify any action tags, such as @run, @compile,
                     etc, since the actions are implicit for every test in the group
                     of tests. </p>
</li>
