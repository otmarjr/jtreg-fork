<h1>1.4.
                                What is the JavaTest<sup>TM</sup> harness?</h1>
                
<p>The JavaTest harness is a set of tools designed to execute test programs.
                It was originally designed to execute tests in the
                Java<sup>TM</sup> 2 SE Technology Compatibility Kit (TCK)
                (formerly the Java Compatibility Kit (JCK)).
                Among other things, the harness has evolved the ability to execute
                non-JCK testsuites.  The JDK regression test suite is one such suite.</p>

                
<p>An open source version of the harness is available at
                <code>http://jtharness.java.net/</code>.
                </p>
