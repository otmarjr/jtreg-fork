<h1>2.19.
                                How does a manual applet test
            indicate success or failure?</h1>
                
<p>Just as with <code>main</code> tests, an applet may throw an exception
                at any time to indicate test failure.  A <code>done</code> test applet, for
                example, can check for failure in the <code>java.applet.Applet.destroy</code>
                method.  If an applet doesn't throw an exception, and if, in the case of a
                <code>yesno</code> test, the user clicks <code>pass</code>, then the test is
                considered to have passed.</p>

                
<p>Be very careful about where failure is checked.  The AWT event thread does
                not propagate exceptions!</p>
