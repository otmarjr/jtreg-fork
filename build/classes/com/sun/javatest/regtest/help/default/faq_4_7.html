<h1>4.7.
                                 How does jtreg run TestNG tests?
            </h1>
                
<p>Tests using "@run testng" are compiled in the standard way,
                with TestNG libraries on the classpath.
                The test is run using the class <code>org.testng.TestNG</code>.
                For any TestNG test in a group of TestNG tests, any tests in the
                group that need compiling are compiled together before any
                test in the group is run.
                Then, the selected test classes are run one at a time using
                <code>org.testng.TestNG</code>.
                Each test that is run will have its results stored in a
                corresponding *.jtr file.
