                                Why not have separate test
            workspaces that only contain tests?</h1>
                
<p>Checking a test into the workspace against which it's first written
                helps prevent spurious test failures.  In the case of a regression test, this
                process ensures that a regression test will migrate upward in the integration
                hierarchy along with the fix for the corresponding bug.  If tests were managed
                separately from fixes then it would be difficult to distinguish between a true
                test failure and a failure due to version skew because the fix hadn't caught up
                with the test.</p>
