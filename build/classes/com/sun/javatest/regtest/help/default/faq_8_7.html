<p>A single directory contains more than one file with the same basename.</p>

                
<p>
<b>Answer</b>: The two files contain descriptions of tests and the harness is
                unable to determine a unique <a href="#question3.5"><code>.jtr</code></a> filename so
                the harness will overwrite the results of the first test.  It is possible to have
                a single directory with more than one file with the same basename; however,
                only one of those files may have a test description (<code>@test</code> is the
                first token of the comment).</p>

                
<p>If both files contain identical test descriptions, select one file to
                contain the primary test description. Disable the other test description by
                either removal of the entire comment or simply the <code>@test</code> tag.</p>

                
<p>If the files contain unique test descriptions, one of the basefile names must
                be changed.</p>
