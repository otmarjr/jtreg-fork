<h1>3.13.
                                Which should I use? MKS or Cygwin?</h1>
                
<p>
<code>jtreg</code> supports both, equally. However, the tests in the
                JDK regression test suite assume that MKS is available. So, when you
                are writing tests for that test suite, you should make sure that your
                test at least works with MKS. If you prefer to use Cygwin, and can make
                your test run with both, so much the better.</p>
                
<p>
<strong>Note:</strong> as of JDK 8, the
                tests assume the use of Cygwin by default.</p>
