                            General Problems</h1>
<ol>
<li>
<a href="faq_5_1.html">My test only passes if I don't use jtreg to run it.
            Why does it fail in jtreg?</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="faq_5_2.html">How do I set the
            <code>CLASSPATH</code> environment variable for my test?</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="faq_5_3.html">Why don't you just pass all of my
            shell environment variables to the JVM running the test?</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="faq_5_4.html">Why is the default to run tests in
            another JVM?</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="faq_5_5.html">Why would I ever want to run in the
            same JVM?</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="faq_5_6.html">What is "agent VM" mode, and why would I want to use it?</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="faq_5_7.html">Should a test call the
            <code>System.exit</code> method?</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="faq_5_8.html">My test only applies to one
            platform and it will fail/not run in others.  How do I prevent the harness from
            running it on the wrong platform?</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="faq_5_9.html">How can I make
            <code>applet</code> and <code>main</code> action tests read from data
            files?</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="faq_5_10.html">Can I use <code>package</code>
            statements in my tests?</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="faq_5_11.html">Why can't multiple test source
            files in the same directory have package-private classes of the same
            name?</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="faq_5_12.html">Should a test catch
            <code>Throwable</code>, <code>Exception</code>, or
            <code>Error</code>?</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="faq_5_13.html">My test requires that I use
            information printed to <code>System.out</code> or <code>System.err</code> to
            determine whether a test passed or failed.  When I run my test in the harness, I
            can't seem to find these output streams.</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="faq_5_14.html">My test does tricky things that are
            not supported by <code>jtreg</code>. Can I still write a regression
            test?</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="faq_5_15.html">What happens if my test returns
            when there are still threads running?</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="faq_5_16.html">If my bug hasn't been fixed, and
            the test is run, the JVM crashes.  How do I make sure that the test doesn't
            cause the harness to crash?</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="faq_5_17.html">The JavaTest harness is running into problems
            running the test because of issues with the JDK I'm trying to test. What can I
            do?</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="faq_5_18.html">My test requires that I install my
            own security manager, but it appears that the JavaTest harness has already installed
            one. What do I do?</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="faq_5_19.html">Can I automate running regtests or
            can I run the tests on a regular basis?</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="faq_5_20.html">I run all (or a huge part) of the
            regression test suite as part of a cron job or other nightly process.  I'd like
            to generate my own reports or I'd like to send myself e-mail whenever a test
            fails.  Do I have to parse the verbose output or the <code>.jtr</code>
            file?</a>
