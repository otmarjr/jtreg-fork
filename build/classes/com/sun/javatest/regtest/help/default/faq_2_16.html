<h1>2.16.
                                How do I write a test for an AWT
            bug or a Swing bug?</h1>
                
<p>Bugs in the graphical facilities of the JDK generally require
                manual interaction with applets.  Applet tests are written in much the
                same way as the simple <code>main</code> tests described above.  The
                primary differences are that a second "@" tag is given to indicate
                that the test is an applet test, and an appropriate HTML file is
                needed.  For example, an AWT test named <code>Foo.java</code> would
                have the form:</p>

                
<dl>
<dt></dt>
<dd>
                    
<pre>
                        /* @test 1.1 97/10/12
                           @bug 9876543
                           @run applet/manual Foo.html */

                        public class Foo extends java.awt.Applet { ... }
                    </pre>
                
</dd>
</dl>
                
<p>or</p>
                
<dl>
<dt></dt>
<dd>
                    
<pre>
                        public class Foo extends javax.swing.JApplet { ... }
                    </pre>
                
</dd>
</dl>

                
<p>The <code>@run</code> tag tells the harness how to run the test.  The first
                argument is the run type, <code>applet</code>, followed by an option,
                <code>/manual</code>, that flags this test as a manual test requiring user
                interaction.  The remaining arguments to the <code>@run</code> tag are passed
                to the program in a manner appropriate to the run type.  In this case, the test
                will be run just as if the <code>appletviewer</code> had been invoked on
                <code>Foo.html</code>.  Thus <code>Foo.html</code> must contain, at least, an
                HTML <code>applet</code> tag with any necessary parameters.</p>
