<h1>5.14.
                                My test does tricky things that are
            not supported by <code>jtreg</code>. Can I still write a regression
            test?</h1>
                
<p>Yes.  Most tests can be written using a series of <code>main</code>,
                <code>clean</code>, <code>build</code>, <code>applet</code>, and
                <code>compile</code> actions.  However, there have been a few tests that need
                to do things like run a specific application or access specific environment
                variables.  The <code>shell</code> action allows a user to invoke a Bourne
                shell-script which can run arbitrary commands, including running
                <code>java</code> and <code>javac</code>.</p>

                
<p>
<b>Warning!</b> All tests, including shell-script tests, may be run on
                multiple platforms including Linux, Solaris, Windows and Mac OS X. The
                shell-script should be written to with this in mind.  The following code
                fragment may be useful in defining various platform-dependent variables.</p>

<p>If the <code>shell</code> action still does not provide the flexibility
                needed to write the regression test, then use the <code>ignore</code> action.
                It is also advisable to include a comment with sufficient detail to allow a
                person to run the test and verify its behavior.</p>
