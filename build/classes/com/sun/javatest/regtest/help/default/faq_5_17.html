<h1>5.17.
                                The JavaTest harness is running into problems
            running the test because of issues with the JDK I'm trying to test. What can I
            do?</h1>
                
<p>When the harness is used to run tests, two possibly different versions of
                the JDK are used: the JDK version used to run the harness and the JDK version used
                to run the test(s) themselves.</p>

                
<p>To run the harness with one version of the JDK and the tests with another, use
                the <code>-othervm</code> option in conjunction with the <code>-testjdk</code>
                option.  The <code>-testjdk</code> option will specify the version of the JDK
                to run the tests.  The environment variables <code>JT_JAVA</code> or
                <code>JAVA_HOME</code> will specify the version of the JDK for the harness.</p>
