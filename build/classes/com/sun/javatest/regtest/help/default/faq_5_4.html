<h1>5.4.
                                Why is the default to run tests in
            another JVM?</h1>
                
<p>Insulation from other tests.  Most well-behaved tests do not modify the
                JVM; however, if a test does modify the JVM it is possible that this change
                will interfere with subsequent tests.  Running each test in another JVM allows
                for the possibility of bad test suite citizens.</p>
