<h1>4.3.
                                Can I have more than one TEST.ROOT?
            </h1>
                
<p>In general, no.  Each test is uniquely associated with
                exactly one test root directory, which is the the smallest
                enclosing directory containing a marker file called TEST.ROOT.
                In general, a test run will consist of tests from a single
                test suite, identified by a single test root directory.
                </p>
                
<p>It <em>is</em> possible to run tests from multiple test suites
                (such as jdk/test and langtools/test) but this is not common. </p>
