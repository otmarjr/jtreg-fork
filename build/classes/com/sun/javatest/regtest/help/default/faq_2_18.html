<h1>2.18.
                                Exactly what does the
            <code>/manual</code> option mean?</h1>
                
<p>The <code>/manual</code> option indicates to the harness that this is a
                manual test.  This allows the harness to distinguish manual from automatic
                tests, which is important since the latter can be run without user interaction.</p>

                
<p>There are actually three kinds of applet manual tests: Self-contained tests,
                <code>yesno</code> tests, and <code>done</code> tests.</p>

                
<p>A self-contained manual test handles all user interaction itself.  If the
                test fails, whether this is determined by the user or by the applet, then the
                applet must throw an exception.  Self-contained tests specify
                <code>applet/manual</code> for the first <code>@run</code> argument.</p>

                
<p>A <code>yesno</code> test requests the harness to ask the user whether the test
                passes or fails.  To do this, the harness will put up <code>pass</code> and
                <code>fail</code> buttons, and it's up to the user to inspect the screen and
                click one of the buttons.  The harness will take care of shutting down the applet.
                The test will also fail if the applet throws an exception.  <code>Yesno</code>
                tests specify <code>applet/manual=yesno</code> for the first <code>@run</code>
                argument.</p>

                
<p>A <code>done</code> test requests the harness to put up a <code>done</code>
                button.  After the user has completed whatever actions are required by the
                test, the user clicks <code>done</code> and the harness shuts down the applet.
                The program must itself determine whether the test is to pass or fail, and
                throw an exception in the latter case.  <code>Done</code> tests specify
                <code>applet/manual=done</code> for the first <code>@run</code> argument.</p>

                
<p>
<code>main</code> and <code>shell</code> may also specify the
                <code>manual</code> option using <code>main/manual</code> and
                <code>shell/manual</code> respectively.  These tests must be completely
                self-contained.</p>
