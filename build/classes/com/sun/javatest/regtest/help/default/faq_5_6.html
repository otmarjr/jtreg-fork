                                What is "agent VM" mode, and why would I want to use it?</h1>
                
<p>It's like "same VM" mode, but better. By default, tests will run in
                the same JVM. In between tests, jtreg will try to reset the JVM to
                a standard state, and if it cannot, it will discard the JVM and
                start another. </p>
