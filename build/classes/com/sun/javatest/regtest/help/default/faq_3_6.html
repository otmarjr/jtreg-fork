<p>The report directory contains all final reports in HTML format.  By
                default, the name of the report directory is <code>JTreport</code>.  The name
                may be selected via the <code>-reportDir</code> option to <code>jtreg</code>.</p>

                
<p>The work directory contains any files which are generated during a test run.
                These include <code>.class</code> and <code>.jtr</code>
                files.  By default, the name of the work directory is <code>JTwork</code>.  The
                name may be selected via the <code>-workDir</code> option to
                <code>jtreg</code>.</p>
