<h1>6.3.
                                How do I decide whether my applet
            test should use the <code>main</code> action or the <code>applet</code>
            action?</h1>
                
<p>Ultimately, that decision is left to the person writing the test;
                however, the following should be considered.</p>

                
<p>Tests which use the <code>applet</code> action are <i>not</i>
                necessarily restricted to tests which must run in a browser. Any
                Swing/AWT code which can be written such that it derives from
                <code>java.applet.Applet</code> or <code>javax.swing.JApplet</code> is
                a potential applet test.</p>

                
<p>For tests which test graphics functionality, there are three major
                advantages to selecting the <code>applet</code> action over the
                <code>main</code> action: expanded <code>manual</code> support leading to less
                duplicated code per test, thread synchronization, and cleanup.</p>

                
<p>Frequently, tests which test graphics functionality need some sort of user
                interaction to determine whether the test behaves as expected. The
                <code>applet</code> action takes care of providing a user interface which
                contains instructions for the user and the appropriate interface to indicate
                <code>pass</code>, <code>fail</code>, or <code>done</code> as indicated by the
                <code>manual</code> option.  User instructions are taken from the
                <code>.html</code> file referenced in the <code>applet</code> action.  Each
                <code>main</code> action which tests graphics functionality must implement
                their own version of this interface.  This path leads to more code needed per
                test and less consistency across tests in the test suite.</p>

                
<p>A <code>main</code> action test is deemed to be completed when the
                <code>main</code> method returns. A test which requires multiple threads must
                take care not to allow the main method to return before those other threads
                have completed. The <code>applet</code> action handles basic AWT thread
                synchronization.</p>

                
<p>Finally, the <code>applet</code> action handles test cleanup.  If a test can
                not or does not dispose top-level windows or any AWT threads, they will be
                eliminated by the harness after the test completes.</p>
