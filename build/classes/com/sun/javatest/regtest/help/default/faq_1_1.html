<h1>1.1.
                                What's the purpose of this test framework?</h1>
                
<p>The test framework described here is intended primarily for
                unit and regression  tests.
                It can also be used for functional tests, and even simple
                product tests -- in other words, just about any type of test except a
                conformance test.  (Conformance tests belong in a Technology
                Compatibility Kit (TCK), such as the Java Compatibility Kit (JCK)).
                Tests can often be written as small standalone Java programs, although
                in some cases an applet or a shell-script might be required.</p>
