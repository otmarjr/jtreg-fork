<h1>2.13.
                                How should I name a test?</h1>
                
<p>In general, try to give tests names that are as specific and descriptive
                as possible.  If a test is checking the behavior of one or a few methods, its
                name should include the names of those methods.  For example, a test written
                for a bug in the skip method of FileInputStream could be placed in
                <code>test/java/io/FileInputStream/Skip.java</code>.  A test written for a bug
                that involves both the skip and available methods could be named
                <code>SkipAvailable.java</code>.</p>

                
<p>Tests that involve many methods require a little more creativity in naming,
                since it would be unwieldy to include the names of all the methods.  Just
                choose a descriptive word or short phrase.  For example, a test that checks the
                general behavior of a FileInputStream after end-of-file has been reached could
                be named <code>AfterEOF.java</code>.</p>

                
<p>It can be helpful to add more information to the test name to help further
                describe the test.  For example, a test that checks the skip method's behavior
                when passed a negative count could be named <code>SkipNegative.java</code>.</p>

                
<p>You might find that the name you want to give your test has already been
                taken.  In this case either find a different name or, if you're just not in a
                creative mood, append an underscore and a digit to an existing name.  Thus if
                there were already a <code>Skip.java</code> file, a new test for the skip
                method could be named <code>Skip_1.java</code>.</p>

                
<p>Some tests require more than one source file, or may need access to data
                files.  In this case it's best to create a subdirectory in order to keep
                related files together.  The subdirectory should be given a descriptive
                mixed-case name that begins with a lowercase letter.  For example, a
                FileInputStream test that needs an input file as well as its Java source file
                in order to test the interaction of the read and available methods could be
                placed in the subdirectory
                <code>test/java/io/FileInputStream/readAvailable</code>.</p>

                
<p>Some tests involve more than one class in a package, in which case a new
                subdirectory in the relevant package directory should be created.  For example,
                a set of general tests that exercise the character streams in the
                <code>java.io</code> package could be placed in the
                <code>test/java/io/charStreams</code> directory.</p>
