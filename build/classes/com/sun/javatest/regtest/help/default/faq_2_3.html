<h1>2.3.
                                What do the other tags mean?</h1>
                
<p>The other tags shown above are optional.</p>

                
<p>The <code>@bug</code> tag should be followed by one or more bug numbers,
                separated by spaces.  The bug number is useful in diagnosing test failures.
                It's OK to write tests that don't have bug numbers, but if you're writing a
                test for a specific bug please include its number in an <code>@bug</code> tag.</p>

                
<p>The <code>@summary</code> tag describes the condition that is checked by the
                test.  It is especially useful for non-regression tests, which by definition
                don't have bug numbers, but even if there's a bug number it's helpful to
                include a summary.  Note that a test summary is generally not the same thing as
                a Bugtraq synopsis, since the latter describes the bug rather than the
                condition that the bug violates.</p>
