<h1>4.2.
                                Why is the "test root directory" important?
            </h1>
                
<p>Within the test suite, tests are uniquely identified by their path
                relative to the test root directory.
                This relative path is used to generate test-specific directories
                and files within the work directory, and to identify test results
                within the report directory.</p>
                
<p>However, note that tests can be specified on the command line
                by any valid file system path, either absolute or relative to the
                current directory.
                </p>
