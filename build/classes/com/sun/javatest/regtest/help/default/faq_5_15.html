                                What happens if my test returns

<p>The harness runs the <code>main</code> action's <code>main</code> method in
                its own thread group.  The thread group will be destroyed by the harness when the
                <code>main</code> method returns.  It is the responsibility of the test to
                return only after the appropriate tasks have been completed by its subsidiary
                threads.</p>
