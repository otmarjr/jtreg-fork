<h1>4.4.
                                What is a "package root"?
            </h1>
                
<p>"package root" refers the root of the package hierarchy in
                 which a Java source is placed. It is the directory you would
                 put on the javac source path if you wanted javac to compile
                 the file explicitly.</p>
                
<p>Most jtreg tests are written in the "unnamed package"
                 (i.e. without a package statement) and so for most jtreg tests,
                 the directory directly containing the test is the package root
                 for the test.  This is different from other test suites using
                 other test harnesses (such as TestNG) in which all the tests
                 of a test suite are placed in a single package hierarchy,
                 often mirroring the package hierarchy of API being tested.</p>
