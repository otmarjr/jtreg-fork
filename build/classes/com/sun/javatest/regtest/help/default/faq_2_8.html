<h1>2.8.
                                Can a test check the output of
            <code>System.out</code> and <code>System.err</code>?</h1>
                
<p>Yes, compiler tests using the <code>@compile</code> tag can use
                the <code>/ref=<i>file</i></code> option.
                Such tests are generally not recommended, since the output can be
                sensitive to the locale in which the are run, and may contain
                other details which may be hard to maintain, such as line numbers.</p>
                
<p>While not part of the tag specification, some tests use the
                string "<code>/nodynamiccopyright/</code>" after the <code>@test</code> tag
                to indicate that that the file should not be subject to automated
                copyright processing that might affect the operation of the test.</p>
