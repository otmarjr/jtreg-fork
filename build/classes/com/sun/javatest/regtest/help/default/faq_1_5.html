<h1>1.5.
                                What are the JDK regression extensions to the JavaTest harness?
                What is "regtest"?</h1>
                
<p>For the harness to execute tests in a given test suite, it needs
                specialized code which knows how to find test descriptions and how to interpret
                those descriptions.  The
                <a href="tag-spec.html">JDK Test Framework: Tag Language Specification</a>
                provides the needed descriptions.
                <code>regtest</code> refers to extensions for the JavaTest harness that
                implement this specification, and is an older name for what is now known as
                "jtreg".</p>
