<h1>5.9.
                                How can I make
            <code>applet</code> and <code>main</code> action tests read from data
            files?</h1>
                
<p>When jtreg is executed, it <code>cd's</code> into a scratch area to
                ensure that a test can not alter the test suite.  Thus, a direct reference to a
                data file without some sort of indicator as to where the test was originally
                located will fail.</p>

                
<p>The system property <code>test.src</code> contains the name of the directory
                where the test source resides.  The following example illustrates how to read
                the data file <code>foo</code> which is contained in the test source directory.
                Note that the default value of <code>"."</code> allows this test to run both
                with the harness, and without (in the source directory).</p>
