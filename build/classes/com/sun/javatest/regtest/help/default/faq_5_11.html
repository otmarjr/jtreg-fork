<h1>5.11.
                                Why can't multiple test source
            files in the same directory have package-private classes of the same
            name?</h1>
                
<p>In the Java language, package private classes defined in different files
                in the same directory are interpreted as duplicate class definitions.  The
                contents of the class files depends on the order of compilation.  To avoid
                compilation order dependency problems, we recommend that you define auxiliary
                classes as inner classes.</p>

                
<p>For performance reasons, the harness does not automatically remove class files
                between individual tests or build each test within its own unique subdirectory.
                This allows us to cache class files across test runs and share code between tests
                in the same directory.</p>
