<h1 class="glossTerm">Serial Agent</h1>

<p class="glossText">
Use serial mode (serial agent) when you want the agent to use an RS-232 serial connection. Serial agents wait for the JT Harness harness to initiate the connection. Infrared, parallel, USB, and firewire connections can also be added through the JT Harness API by modeling the existing serial system.
