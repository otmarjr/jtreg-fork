<H1>Troubleshooting Active Agents</H1>
<p>
Active agents initiate the connection with the JT Harness harness. You must set up the JT Harness harness agent pool so that the connection is made before running tests. 
</p>
<p>
Errors in configuring, synchronizing, or implementing the connection between the agent and the JT Harness harness are the most probable causes of failure.
</p>

<p>
Use the Agent Monitor window, the JT Harness harness Test Manager window, the agent
  GUI, and the following list of actions as a guide when troubleshooting
  problems running active agents.</p>

<ol>
<li>
In the Agent Monitor window, verify that the agent is listed in the agent pool.
  If the agent is not listed in the agent pool perform the following actions:
  <ol type="a">
<li>
Verify that the Listening check box is selected.
</li>
<li>
Verify that the agent is configured to contact the correct active host and that the port value of the harness matches the port value used by the agent.
</li>
<li>
Check the physical connection between the JT Harness harness platform and the test platform.
</li>
</ol>
</li>

<li>
Verify that the agent moves to Agents Currently in Use when tests are running.
  If the agent does not move to Agents Currently in Use when tests are running
  perform the following actions:
  <ol type="a">
<li>
Use the Configuration Editor in the Test Manager window to verify that the harness
  is configured to use agents when running tests. See the <em>JT Harness
  User's Guide: Graphical User Interface</em> for detailed description of the
  Configuration Editor and the Test Manager window.
</li>

<li>
If you are running the tests using multiple Java Virtual Machines, use the Configuration
  Editor window to verify that the path you provided in the Java Launcher question
  is the path of the  launcher for the <em>agent</em> running
  tests.
</li>
</ol>
</li>

<li>
If tests are failing or have errors, check the error messages displayed in the
  Test Manager window. If the error indicates that tests are failing because
  of missing classes perform the following actions:
  <ol type="a">
<li>
Verify that the class paths used to start the agent are correct.
</li>

<li>
Use the Configuration Editor window to verify that the harness is correctly configured to use the agent on the test system.
</li>

<li>
Run the agent using the <code>-trace</code> option to verify that the paths in the stream messages for the test are correct. If the paths are not correct for the test system, create a map file for the agent to use in translating host specific values into values that the agent can use. See <a href="mapFile.html">"Creating a Map File</a></li>

<li> 
If a map file was used to run the test, use the Test Run Messages pane to verify
  that the <code>-mapArgs</code> command is present in the stream messages. If
  the <code>-mapArgs</code> command is not present, verify that both the agent <em>and</em> the
  harness are configured to use the map file. Use the Configuration Editor window
  to verify that the harness is configured to use the agent map file.
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
