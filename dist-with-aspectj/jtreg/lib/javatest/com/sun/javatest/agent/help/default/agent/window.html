<H1>Agent Monitor Window</H1>

<p>
Open the Agent Monitor window by using the JT Harness harness GUI Test Manager
  to choose
Window <code><b>-&gt;</b></code> Open <code><b>-&gt;</b></code> Agent Monitor.
See the <em>JT Harness User's Guide: Graphical User Interface</em> for
detailed description of the Test Manager window.</p>

<p>
The Agent Monitor window contains two sections,  Agent Pool and  Agents Currently
  In Use.
</p>

<a name="window.agentPool"><!-- index:Agent Monitor window; agent pool --><!-- index:agent pool  --></a>
<h2>Agent Pool</h2>
<p>
Agent Pool lists the active agents that are available to run tests. When active
  agents connect to the JT Harness harness, they are added to the agent pool. When
  the JT Harness harness requires an active agent to run a test, it moves the agent
  from  Agent Pool to  Agents Currently In Use  until the test is
  completed.
</p>

<p>
The following table lists and describes the contents of the Agent Pool GUI.</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="5" class="gray.wide" summary="The contents and description of the Agent Pool GUI." title="Agent Pool GUI Contents">

<tr valign="top">
<th width="25%" scope="col" class="left">
Field
</th>
<th scope="col" class="left">
Description
</th>
</tr>

<tr valign="top">
<td scope="row"><code>Listening</code></td>
<td>
Click the check box to enable listening for active agents. If listening is not
  enabled when an agent starts, the agent issues a message that it cannot connect
  to the JT Harness harness and then waits for its timeout period to end before
  attempting to recontact the harness.
</td>
</tr>

<tr valign="top">
<td scope="row"><code>Port</code></td>
<td>
Port 1907 is the default port used by active agents. If your agent uses a different port, you must either change the value used by the agent or change this value to match the agent.
</td>
</tr>

<tr valign="top">
<td scope="row"><code>Timeout</code></td>
<td>
When the agent pool is empty, the timeout value sets the number of seconds that
  the JT Harness harness waits between tests for an available agent before reporting
  the test result as an error. If you run tests with one agent, a latent period
  might occur between the time when the agent completes the test and when it
  returns to the agent pool. The timeout value must be greater than the agent's
  latent period. The default value of 180 seconds is usually sufficient.
</td>
</tr>

</table>


<a name="window.agentInUse"><!-- index:Agent Monitor window; agents currently used --><!-- index:agents currently used  --></a>
<h2>Agents Currently In Use</h2>
<p>
Agents Currently In Use lists all agents currently used by the JT Harness harness
  to run tests. When agents are not running tests they are removed from the list
  (active agents re-register with the agent pool). Click on an agent in the list
  to display detailed information about the agent and the test it is running.
  The detailed information is displayed in the text fields at the bottom and
  can be used to troubleshoot problems using an agent to run tests.
