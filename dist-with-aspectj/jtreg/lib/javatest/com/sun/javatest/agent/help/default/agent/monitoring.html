<H1>Monitoring JT Harness Agents</H1>

<p>
You can monitor JT Harness harness agents in one of the following ways:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    View all agents in a test system that are running tests. Refer to <a href="window.html">Agent Monitor Window</a> for
    detailed information about opening and using the Agent Monitor window to
    view all agents in a test system that are running tests. </li>
  <li> Monitor specific information about an agent and the tests that it runs.
    To display information about the agent, you must use the tabbed panes in
    the application or applet GUI. See the following topics for detailed information
    about the GUI:
  <ul>
    <li> 
    <a href="statisticsPane.html"><b>Statistics Pane</b></a>:  Displays
    the current status of the tests that the agent is running.
    </li>
    <li>
    <a href="historyPane.html"><b>History Pane</b></a>:  Displays a
    list of tasks performed by the agent.
    </li>
    <li>
    <a href="taskPane.html"><b>Selected Task Pane</b></a>:  Displays
    details about a specific task or test chosen in the history tabbed pane.
    </li>
  </ul>
</li>
</ul>
