<h1>JT Harness harness agent</h1>
<p>
An agent is a separate program that works in conjunction with the JT Harness harness to run tests on a system other than the one that is running the JT Harness harness.
</p>
<p>
You can use custom agents or the JT Harness harness agent provided with the harness to run tests. The topics in this section describe how to configure and run the agent provided with the JT Harness harness. If you are using a custom agent, refer to your test suite documentation for a description of how to configure and run the agent.
</p>

Depending on your test suite, agents are typically used to run tests on small
devices that do not support online help. The <em>JT Harness Agent's User
Guide</em> is provided in PDF format so that you can use an appropriate viewer
 to view and print the contents of the JT Harness harness agent online help.</p>
