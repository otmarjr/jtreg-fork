<H1>History Pane</H1>

<p>
The agent GUI uses the history tabbed pane to enable monitoring and
  troubleshooting agent activity by displaying a dynamic list of tasks
  that an agent is currently executing and tasks that an agent  recently completed.
  The number of tasks maintained in this list is not configurable. </p>
<center>
<IMG SRC="../../images/agentGUIhistory.gif" ALT="The history tabbed pane in the agent GUI" longdesc="historyPane.html" >
</center>
<p>
To view the details about a specific task, click on it in the list.
  The GUI displays the selected task tabbed pane contained details about the
  task.
</p>
<p>
Refer to <a href="taskPane.html">Selected Task Pane</a> for a detailed description
of the task information that is displayed. 
</p>

<p>
Each task in the list contains a code indicating its current state.

The following table describes the state codes displayed in the GUI. </p>
<table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="5"  class="gray.wide" summary="List of the current states a task can be in." title="Current State Codes">

<tr valign="top">
<th width="25%" scope="col" class="left">
Current State

<tr valign="top">
<td scope="row">
CONN host:port 
</td>
<td>
Shows that the JT Harness harness agent has an open connection to the JT Harness
  harness, at the specified network address, and that the JT Harness harness agent
  is waiting for a request to be sent over the connection. If the JT Harness harness
  agent is running in active mode, it waits until JT Harness harness sends the
  request. If the agent is running in passive mode, this state usually appears
   temporarily because JT Harness harness normally initiates a connection and
  then immediately sends the request. The host  normally is identified by
  its host name. If JT Harness harness cannot determine the host name, the IP address
  of the host is shown instead. 
</td>
</tr>

<tr valign="top">
<td scope="row">
EXEC tag 
</td>
<td>
This state shows that the JT Harness harness agent is executing a task on behalf of JT Harness harness. The tag is an identification of the task supplied by JT Harness harness as part of the request. 
</td>
</tr>

<tr valign="top">
<td scope="row">
*IO* tag 
</td>
<td>
This state shows that the JT Harness harness agent was executing a task on behalf
  of JT Harness harness but that some exception occurred while trying to send the
  results to the JT Harness harness.
</td>
</tr>
</table>



<p>
If a task in the list displays a state from the following table, this indicates
  that the JT Harness harness agent has completed a request for JT Harness harness.
  These states correspond to the various possible outcomes of the task and are
  the same as the outcomes that the JT Harness harness gets when it runs tests
  directly (without the assistance of the JT Harness harness agent). The following
  table describes the states that a task might have.</p>
