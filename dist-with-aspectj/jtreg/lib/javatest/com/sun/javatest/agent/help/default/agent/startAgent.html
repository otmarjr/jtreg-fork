<h1>Starting a JT Harness Agent</h1>
<p>
You can start an agent either as an application or as an applet. While the application
  provides you with the option of using either a GUI or a command line to configure
  and run the agent, the applet requires that you use a GUI. The following table
  describes the agent interface support for application and applets.</p>

<h2>Agent Application</h2>

<p>
You can either use the application GUI or command line to configure and start an agent if the test system provides AWT support.
</p> 

<p>
If a test platform is unable to or does not provide AWT support, you must use
  the command line to configure and start the agent. When using the command line
  to directly configure and run an agent, the following conditions apply:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
All agent options must be specified in the command line.</li>
<li>
Agent performance cannot be monitored during a test run.</li>
<li>
Agent properties cannot be modified without killing the agent and starting a
  new agent from the command line.</li>
</ul>

<p>
If you use the GUI to run the agent, the following conditions apply:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Agent options can be included in the command line or the GUI can be started
  without specifying agent options.</li>
<li>
Agent performance is monitored  during a test run.</li>
<li> Agent can be configured or reconfigured after the GUI starts.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The GUI used by the application is the same as that used by the applet. Refer to <a href="#startAgent.gui">Using the GUI</a> for a description of the tabbed panes.
</p>

<a name="startAgent.applet"><!-- index:starting a JT Harness agent; applet --><!-- index:JT Harness agent; applet; starting --></a>
<h2>Agent Applet</h2>

<p>
You can use either an applet or an application to run the agent on any test system
  that supports a web browser. However, you must use the applet when testing
  Java virtual machines that run in web browsers.</p>
<p>
The GUI used by the applet is the same as that used by the application. Refer to <a href="#startAgent.gui">Using the GUI</a>   for a description of the tabbed panes.
</p>
<p>
When using the applet, you can perform the following actions:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Include parameters in the applet tag or start the GUI without specifying any parameters
</li>
<li>
Configure or reconfigure the agent after the GUI starts
</li>
<li>
Monitor agent performance during a test run.
</li>
</ul>

<a name="startAgent.gui"><!-- index:JT Harness agent; GUI --></a>
<h2>Using the GUI</h2>
<p>
The GUI contains four tabbed panes and three buttons used to configure, control, and monitor the agent.
</p>

<li>The statistics tabbed pane displays detailed information about the tests that the agent is running.

<li>The history and selected task tabbed panes allow you to monitor tasks performed by the agent.
