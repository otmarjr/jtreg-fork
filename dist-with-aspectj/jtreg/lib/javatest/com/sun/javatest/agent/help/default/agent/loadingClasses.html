<h1>Installing Agent Classes on a Test System</h1>
<p>
Before you can use the JT Harness harness agent to run tests, you must load the agent classes on your test system. You can load the agent classes by doing one of the following:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Copy the <code>javatest.jar</code> file directly to the test system if adequate space is available (approximately 5.7megs). The <code>javatest.jar</code> file contains all of the required JT Harness harness agent classes.
</li>

<li>
Extract the minimum set of classes from the <code>javatest.jar</code> file for the type of agent user interface and copy them to the test system.
</li>
</ul>
 <p>The following table provides links to the required classes for each type
   of agent user interface.</p>
 <table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="3" class="gray" summary="List of the minimum set of classes required for the agent user interface that you are using." title="Agent User Interface Required Classes">
<tr valign="top">
