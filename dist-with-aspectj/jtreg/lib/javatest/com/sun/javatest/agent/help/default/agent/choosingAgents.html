<h1>Choosing the Type of Agent</h1>

<p>
The JT Harness harness agent is a lightweight program compatible with Java Development
  Kit, version 1.1, that uses a bi-directional serial connection supporting both
  TCP/IP and RS-232 protocols to communicate between the test system and the
  JT Harness harness.
</p>
<p>
You can use the agent provided by the JT Harness harness if your test system meets the following minimum requirements:
</p>

<ul>
<li>The device supports a communication layer that can last the duration of a
  test (several minutes).
</li>
<li>
The device must be able to have the agent classes loaded on it.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
The type of agent that you use depends on the communication protocol used between
  your test system and the JT Harness harness and on the type of initial connection
  made between the agent and the JT Harness harness. The following table describes
  the types of agent and the communication protocol.</p>

<td scope="row">
Active
</td>
<td>
Use active mode (active agent) when you want the agent to initiate the connection to the JT Harness harness via TCP/IP.
<p>
Agents using active communication allow you perform the following actions:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Run tests in parallel using many agents at once
</li>
<li>
Specify the test machines at the time you run the tests
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Active agents are used for network connections and are recommended. If the security restrictions of your test system prevent incoming connections then you must use an active agent.
</p>
<p>
The JT Harness harness must be running and agent pool listening must be enabled before starting an active agent. Use the 
<a href="window.html">Agent Monitor window</a>
 in the JT Harness harness GUI to enable listening.
</p>
<p>
If listening is not enabled when the agent starts, it returns an error message and waits until its timeout period ends before re-contacting the JT Harness harness.
</p>

</td>
</tr>

<tr valign="top">
<td scope="row">
Passive
</td>
<td>
Use passive mode (passive agent) when you want the agent to wait for the JT Harness harness to initiate the connection via TCP/IP. 

<p>
Because the JT Harness harness only initiates a connection to a passive agent when
  it runs tests, passive communication has the following characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li>
Requires that you specify the test machine as part of the test configuration,
  not at the time you run the tests
</li>
<li>
Does not allow you to run tests in parallel</li>
</ul>

<p>
Passive agents are used for network connections and must be started before the harness attempts to run tests. If the JT Harness harness issues a request before the passive agent is started, the harness waits for an available agent until its timeout period ends. If the timeout period ends before an agent is available, the JT Harness harness reports an error for the test.
</p>

<tr valign="top">
<td scope="row">
Serial
</td>
<td>
Use serial mode (serial agent) when you want the agent to use an RS-232 serial connection. Serial agents wait for the JT Harness harness to initiate the connection. Infrared, parallel, USB, and firewire connections can also be added through the JT Harness harness API by modeling the existing serial system.

<p>
Because the JT Harness harness only initiates a connection to serial agent when
  it runs tests, serial communication has the following characteristics:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Requires that you specify the test machine as part of the test configuration,
   not at the time you run the tests
</li>
<li>
Does not allow you to run tests in parallel
</li>
</ul></td>
</tr>

<tr valign="top">
<td scope="row">
Other
</td>
<td>
If your system does not meet the minimum requirements or if you have unique performance requirements, you can use the JT Harness harness API to create a custom agent. Refer to your test suite documentation for a description of how to configure and run it.
