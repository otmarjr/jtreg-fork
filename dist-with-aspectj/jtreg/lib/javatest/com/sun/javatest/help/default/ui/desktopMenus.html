<h1>Menus</h1>
<p>The GUI provides two types of menus: desktop and tool. The layout style determines how the menus are displayed in the GUI. The following table describes the two menu types and how the desktop style determines how they are displayed.</p>
<table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="5" class="gray.wide" summary="The two types of menus." title="GUI Menus">

<tr valign="top">
<th width="20%" scope="col" class="left">Menu Type</th>
<th scope="col" class="left">Description</th>
</tr>

<tr valign="top">
<td scope="row">
Desktop
</td>
<td>
Desktop menus are always available to the user in the desktop menu bar.  See <a href="desktopStyles.html">GUI Layout</a> for a detailed description of the GUI layout options available to the user. They include the following menus:
<ul>
<li><a href="#desktopMenus.file">File</a></li>
<li><a href="desktopMenus.html#desktopMenus.tool">Tool</a></li>
<li><a href="#desktopMenus.window">Windows</a></li>
<li><a href="#desktopMenus.help">Help</a></li>
</ul>
</td>
</tr>

<tr valign="top">
<td scope="row">
Tool
</td>
<td>
These menus are unique to specific tools and are only available to the user when that tool window is open. The appropriate tool menus are merged with the desktop menus in a single menu bar.  

  <p>See <a href="agentMonitor.html">Agent Monitor Tool</a> for a description of
  the Agent Monitor tool menus. If your test suite uses the harness agent, see
  the <em>JT Harness Agent User's Guide</em> for a description of the Agent Monitor.</p>
<p>See <a href="../mergeReports/window.html">Report Converter Tool</a> for a description of the Report Converter tool menus.</p>
<p>See <a href="window.html">Test Manager Tool</a> for a description of the Test Manager tool menus.</p>

<h2>File</h2>
<p>
Use the File menu to open files, set user preferences, and exit
  from the harness. The contents of the File menu change dynamically,
  based on the context of the desktop. The harness only enables menus
  when they can be used. The following table describes the contents of the File
menu.</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="5" class="gray.wide" summary="The contents and description of the File menu." title="File Menu Contents">

<td scope="row">Open the Quick Start Wizard
</td> 
<td>
<p><b>Note:&nbsp;</b>Some test suites do not implement the optional Quick&nbsp;Start wizard. It won't be available if the test suite architect disabled it.<br></p>
					<p>Opens the optional Quick Start wizard for you to use for the following tasks:</p>  <ul> 
<li> 
Start a new test run by selecting a test suite, work directory, and a configuration file. If the configuration file is new or incomplete, the harness opens the Configuration Editor after the wizard closes.
</li> 
<li> 
Resume work on a previous test run or browse a test suite without running tests. 
</li> 
<li> 
Browse the contents of a test suite.
</li> 
</ul> 
</td>

<tr valign="top">
  <td scope="row">Create Work Directory </td>
  <td><p>Opens a dialog box that you can use to create a  work directory. When
      you choose to create a new work directory, the harness associates it with
      the test suite opened in the Test Manager tool window. The harness creates
      test result files in the work directory that contain all of the information
      gathered by the  harness during test runs of the test suite.</p>
    <p>See <a href="../start/createDirectory.html">Creating a Work Directory</a> for detailed
    information about creating a work directory.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td scope="row">
Open <b>&gt;</b> Work Directory</td>

<td>
Opens a dialog box that you can use to open an existing work directory. Each
  work directory is associated with a specific test suite and contains information
  from previous test runs. The test result files in the work directory contain
  all of the information gathered by the  harness during test runs.
  <p>
When you choose to open an existing work directory, the harness performs the following actions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
It associates that work directory with the test suite opened in the Test Manager tool window <em>only</em> if the test suite is both a match and has no other work directory already open.</li>
<li>
If it cannot associate the work directory with the open test suite, the harness opens a new Test Manager and loads both the work directory and its associated test suite.</li>
</ul>

<p>See <a href="../start/openDirectory.html">Opening a Work Directory</a> for detailed information about opening a work directory.</p>

</td>

<tr valign="top">

Opens a dialog box you can use to choose a test suite. When you open the test suite, the harness loads it into new Test Manager.

  <p>Exits from the  harness. If you have set your preferences to save your current
    desktop, your current desktop is saved so that all open windows, test suites,
    work directories and configurations are restored the next time that you start
    the harness.</p>
