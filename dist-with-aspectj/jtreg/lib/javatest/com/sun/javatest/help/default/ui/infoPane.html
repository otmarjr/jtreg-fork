<h1>Information Area </h1>
<p>The Test Manager uses the information area to display information about the
  item selected in the test tree. The Test Manager uses
  two views, folder view and test view, to display the information.</p>


<h2>Folder View</h2>
<p>When you click a folder icon in the test tree, the Test Manager displays a Summary tab, a Documentation tab, five status tabs, and a status field containing information from the work directory about a folder and its descendants.
</p>

<p>
The folder view contains
  filtered summary and status information about the tests in a test folder. The
  Test Manager also displays a status message at the bottom of the
  area  about the selected view. The messages can indicate
  that tests in the folder are loading or they can provide detailed status information
  about a selected test.</p>
<p>During a test run, you can use the folder view
    to monitor the status of a folder and its tests. You can also use the folder
    view during troubleshooting to quickly locate and open individual tests
    that had errors or failed during the test run. When a status pane is empty,
    the Test Manager disables its tab. This information is displayed in
    the Summary tabbed pane as values and as a pie chart. The folder view and
    test tree use the same view
      filter when
    displaying information.</p>
  <p>See <a href="../browse/folderInfo.html">Displaying Folder Information </a> for
    detailed information about this view.</p>

  <h2>Test View</h2>
<p>When you click a test icon in the test tree or double click its name in the Folder view, the Test Manager displays tabbed panes that contain detailed information about the selected test.</p>
