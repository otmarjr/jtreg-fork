<h1>Summary Information</h1>

<p>
When you click a folder icon in the test tree, the harness uses the current view filter to display Summary information about the folder's test results.
</p>
<p>
The Summary pane contains header information that identifies the folder and the view filter presented in the Summary table and its associated pie chart. The pie chart displayed in the Summary pane is a graphical representation of the tabular data.
</p>

<p>
The following table describes the filtered work directory information that the
  Summary table and pie chart can display.</p>

The GUI only displays results of those tests in the work directory that match your <em>view</em> filter setting. Changing the view filter used in the Test Manager changes the values displayed in the Summary pane.
</p>
<p>
When using the All Tests view filter, new settings in the current configuration do not change the values displayed in the Summary pane.
</p>
<p>When using the Current Configuration view filter, each time you make a change
  in the configuration, the values displayed in the Summary pane are recalculated
  and displayed based on the new settings in the current configuration. See the
  following example for a description of the use of the Current Configuration
  view filter and the All Tests view filter.</p>

<p class="indent3"><b>Example:</b><br>
If you rerun a set of tests and use   the Current Configuration view
filter with Prior Status: Failed  set in the configuration (see <a href="../confEdit/status.html">Specifying
Prior Status</a>), as actual
test status in the work directory changes from Failed to either Passed or Error,
the test status  displayed in the Summary
pane changes from Failed to  Filtered Out.</p>
<p class="indent3">
If you change the view filter to All Tests, the test tree and Summary pane
  immediately display the actual results of all tests in the work directory,
  regardless of the Prior Status settings in the configuration.</p>

<p>
See <a href="../concepts/troubleshooting.html#troubleshooting.viewing"> Problems Viewing Test Results</a> for additional information about viewing test status in the test tree and Summary pane.
</p>

<p>
Click the appropriate status information tab to identify the individual tests in a category.
