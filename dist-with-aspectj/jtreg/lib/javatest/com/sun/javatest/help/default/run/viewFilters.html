<p>
In the toolbar at the top of the test tree is a list of view filters that you
  can use to select the status of the folders and tests displayed by the test
  tree. The harness includes a Current Configuration filter and an All Tests
  filter. Additional filters, such as certification filters, can also be added
  by the test suite. Refer to your test suite documentation for detailed descriptions
  of any additional filters in the list of view filters.</p>
<p> Selecting a view filter only filters the status (folder colors and counters)
  displayed in the Test Manager window, not the tests that are run. You must
  use the configuration
  editor to filter the tests that are run. See <a href="../confEdit/initialFiles.html">Specifying Tests to Run</a>.</p>
<p>See<a href="../browse/viewFilters.html">View Filters</a> for detailed information about the view filters available in the Test Manager.</p>
