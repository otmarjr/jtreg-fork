<H1>Template Editor</H1>

<p>
You can open the Template Editor by choosing Configure &gt; New Template, Configure &gt; Load Template, or Configure &gt; Load Recent Template in the
Test Manager menu bar. Like the Configuration Editor, the Template Editor provides
users with the following two modes of displaying and working with the questions
and values in a template. </p>
<ul>
  <li>Question Mode</li>
  <li>Quick Set Mode  </li>
</ul>
<p>The harness always opens the Template Editor in Question Mode. </p>
<center><img src="../../images/JT4configEditor.gif" alt="Template Editor opened in Question Mode"  longdesc="openTemplateEditor.html"></center>
<p>In Question Mode, the Template Editor displays all of the questions in the interview and enables
  the Bookmarks feature. You can use the Bookmarks feature to
  only display those questions in a template that a user must answer.</p>
<p>You can use the View menu at any time to change from one mode to the next.
  Because there is only one template file loaded in the Template Editor at a
  time, when you change viewing modes during an editing session, any changes
  that you have made in one viewing mode are automatically reflected in the other
viewing mode.</p>
<p>See <a href="questionModeTE.html">Question Mode</a> for
  detailed information about using this mode to create or edit templates.</p>
<p>In Quick Set Mode, the Template
    Editor filters out the test suite specific questions and displays the remaining questions in logical groupings of the values. The  Quick Set Mode
  displays them in tab form for easy user navigation and access. These values
  are the same as those values displayed in Question Mode. Only the form
  of their presentation to the user is different.</p>
<center><img src="../../images/JT4configEditorQuickSet.gif"  alt="Template Editor in Quick Set Mode" longdesc="openTemplateEditor.html"></center>
<p>In Quick Set Mode, the Bookmarks and Search functions are not
enabled.</p>
<p>See <a href="quickSetTE.html">Quick Set Mode</a> for additional
  information about using this mode to edit templates.</p>
