<p class="glossText">&nbsp;&nbsp;
You can use either the <code>-batch</code> mode option or the current <code>-run</code> command to run tests from the command line or as part of a build process. Unless you are running tests from the command line and are using the GUI to monitor the test run, the <code>-batch</code> mode option is no longer required.
