		<h1>Opening a Test Suite</h1>
		<p>You can open a test suite from either the Test Manager or the Quick Start wizard 
(if it is enabled and you are starting a new test run).</p>
		<p><b>Note:</b> Some test suites do not implement the optional Quick&nbsp;Start wizard. It won't be available if the test suite architect disabled it.</p>
		<h2 class="proc">Open a Test Suite</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Click the Browse button in the Quick Start wizard Test Suite
    panel or choose File <b>&gt;</b> Open Test
    Suite from the Test Manager menu bar.</li>
<li>Use the dialog box to navigate to the test suite.</li>
<li>Click the test suite icon or enter its name in the text field.</li>
<li>Click the Open button.</li>
</ol>
<p>The harness loads the test suite
  in a new <a href="../ui/window.html">Test Manager</a>.</p>

<p>
Before you can run tests, you must open or create a work directory 
and load or create a configuration. If you did not use the Quick Start wizard
to open the Test Manager, you must perform these operations separately. See the
following topics for detailed information about using work directories and configurations:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="openDirectory.html">Opening a Work Directory</a> provides information
  about using an existing work directory for the test run.</li>
  <li><a href="createDirectory.html">Creating a Work Directory</a> provides information
    about creating a new work directory for the test run.</li>
  <li><a href="../templates/usingTemplate.html">Working With Templates</a> provides
    information about using a template in the test
  run. </li>
  <li><a href="../confEdit/createConfiguration.html">Creating a New Configuration</a> provides
    information about creating a new configuration for the test run.</li>
  <li><a href="../confEdit/editConfiguration.html">Editing a Configuration</a> provides
    information about changing configuration values used for the test run.</li>
</ul>
