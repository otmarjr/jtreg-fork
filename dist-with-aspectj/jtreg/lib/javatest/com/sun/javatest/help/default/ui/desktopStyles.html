<h1>GUI Layout</h1>

<p>The harness displays the
opened tool windows as a set of tabbed panes within a single frame or desktop. </p>
<ul>
  <li> Multiple tool windows are managed from a single location. </li>
  <li> The small footprint of the desktop  minimizes obstruction of tool windows
    from other applications. </li>
  <li> If multiple tool windows or multiple applications are open, tabs
    provide visual organization. </li>
</ul>

<p> Tabs at the bottom of each pane enable you to choose the active pane and to
  display it on the top of the stack.

<p>The desktop contains both the desktop menus and the tool menus  from the
  active pane. See <a href="desktopMenus.html">Menus</a> for
  a description of the two types of menus that the harness provides.</p>
  <p>See <a href="prefsDialog.html">Setting Preferences</a> for detailed information
about setting display styles and functional options.</p>
