<h1>Configuration Pane</h1>

<p>
The Configuration tab displays a two-column table of the name-value pairs
  that were derived from the configuration file and actually used to run the
  test. To view this information, select a test from the test tree and choose the Configuration tab.</p>

<p>
 The contents of this pane vary for each test suite.
Because the table contains values that were used when the test was run, it may
  provide valuable information when troubleshooting a test run.
  Refer to your test suite documentation for detailed descriptions
of the name-value pairs for your test.</p>
<h2>Name</h2>
<p>
The names in the table identify test environment properties used by the harness to run the test.
</p>

<h2>Value</h2>
<p>
The values displayed in the table were used to run the test.
