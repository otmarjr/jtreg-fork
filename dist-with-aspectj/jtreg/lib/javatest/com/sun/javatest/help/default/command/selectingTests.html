<CODE>-tests api/javax_swing api/java_awt</CODE>... [<EM>task command</EM>] ...</P>
<P>See <a href="aboutExamples.html">About the Command-Line Examples</A> for a description of the use of <EM>&gt; jtharness</EM> in the example.</P><P>See <a href="commandLine.html">Command-Line Overview</A> for a detailed description of the command line structure.</P>
