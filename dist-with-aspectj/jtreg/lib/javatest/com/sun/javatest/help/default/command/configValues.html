                    This question is used to get a selection from a finite list of possible values. For example, in the question "Which protocol would you use," where
                    the only possible responses are TCP or UDP. These questions are usually displayed in the Configuration Editor and the Template Editor as radio buttons 
                    where you can only select one button at a time.
                    <p>The following is an example of the format used to set this configuration value in a command line:<br>

                    <P>The value supplied is case sensitive. This type of question appears in the Configuration Editor as a set of radio buttons or single-selection list of choices.</P>

                    This question is used to represent a file path. It may be absolute or relative, 
                    depending on the context of the question. See the question's More Info for information about 
                    the requirements.  The value used is generally a platform specific path.  The question may 
                    or may not check to see that the value is valid before it is accepted.

                    This question is primarily used to enter fractional numbers, but can also 
                    accept whole numbers.  It might be used to collect values such as a timeout factor in seconds, 
                    where a value similar to 1.5 might be entered.  It usually appears as a type-in field in both the Configuration Editor and the Template Editor.  
                    The question might be set to reject values outside a 
                    specified range. See the More Info in the Configuration editor or the Template Editor for guidelines regarding  
                    the values required for a specific question.

                    These questions are commonly used to get port numbers or to specify the number of times to do an action. The answers are always restricted to whole numbers and might have further restrictions that 
                    prevent you from using certain ranges of numbers (such as negative numbers).  You might also be restricted to using only a particular set 
                    of pre-determined numbers. In the Configuration Editor and in the Template Editor, these usually appear as plain type-in fields
                    or may be a field which has up and down (spinner) controls to select the number.
                    <p>The following is an example of the format used to set this configuration value in a command line:<br>

                    This question is used when a selection of choices from a finite set of possible values is required from the user. In the 
                    Configuration Editor and Template Editor, this question type resembles the Choice question in that it has a list of choices with checkboxes.
                    The difference between them is that in a Multi Choice question, you can select more than one checkbox.

                    absolute settings and cannot be based on the default or previous value.  You must enter 
                    the full list of values that you want to turn on (corresponding to the items checked in the 
                    Configuration Editor or Template Editor representation).</p>

                <TD valign="top">
                    This question enables you to change a grouped set of property values for a test suite. In the 
                    Configuration Editor and Template Editor, this question type enables the user to view multiple property settings and to change read-write values. The user 
                    can also copy both key and values to the clipboard. Value types supported by this question include integer, float, yes-no, file, and string.
                    In the Configuration Editor and Template Editor, the question can provide suggestions to users for the integer, float, file, and string value types that it
                    contains.
                    <p>The following are examples of the format used to set this configuration value in a command line:<br>

                    <p>
                    Each <CODE>set</code> statement for a Property Question value must contain the question key, the property name, and a new value. The use of an equals sign or a space 
                    is determined by the tool and the type of value that you are changing. You cannot change multiple values within a single set statement.

                    This question contains a generic field that enables you to enter a value. While this is much less restrictive than the integer or the file question,
                    there might be some restrictions on the values that you can enter. In the most restrictive cases, you can only use values that
                    are predefined. The More Info displayed in the Configuration Editor and the Template Editor might indicate what constitutes a legal value 
                    in this field. View the More Info for detailed information about the values that you can enter in this field.

                    This question is used when multiple discrete string values are required from the user.
                    It is usually shown as a interface which allows you to enter a string then add it to a
                    list.  The list of strings provided in the <CODE>set</code> command become the new absolute answer to the question,

        <H2>Using Newlines Inside Strings</H2>
        <P>When setting values of configuration questions in the command line, the internal command parser accepts newlines inside strings if they are preceded by a backslash.</P>
        <P>Depending on the shell you use, it might or might not be possible to enter this directly on the command line.</P>
        <P>If you want to set values with embedded newlines, create a harness batch command file, and put the set commands (and any other commands) in that file. In the batch file, you can enter strings with embedded escaped newlines, as in the following example:</P>
        <P>
        <CODE># switch on verbose mode for commands<BR>verbose:commands<BR># open a jti file<BR>open /home/user1/tmp/idemo.11mar04.jti<BR># set a list of files<BR>set demo.file.simpleFileList  /tmp/aaa\<BR>/tmp/bbb\<BR>/tmp/ccc <BR># set a list of strings<BR>set demo.stringList  111\<BR>2222\<BR>3333 </CODE></P>
        <P>On Solaris, using the Korn shell, you can simply put newline characters into strings.
        </P>
        <P>Example:</P>
        <P><code>$JAVA \<BR>-jar image/lib/javatest.jar \<BR>-verbose:commands \<BR>-open /home/user1/tmp/idemo.11mar04.jti \<BR>-set demo.file.simpleFileList  /tmp/aaa<BR>/tmp/bbb<BR>/tmp/ccc </code></P>
