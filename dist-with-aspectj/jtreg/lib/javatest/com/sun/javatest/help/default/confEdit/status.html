<h2>Prior Status Filter Selections </h2>
<p>By choosing Select tests that match, you can run tests with restrictions based
  on their result from a prior test run. The following table describes the available
  Prior Status filter selections.</p>
<table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="5" class="gray" summary="Run tests with restrictions based on their result from a prior test run." title="Using Prior Status as a Filter">
<tr valign="top">
<th width="20%" scope="col" class="left">

</th>
<th scope="col" class="left">

</tr>

<tr valign="top">
<td scope="row">

<tr valign="top">

<tr valign="top">

</table>

<p>
Prior status is evaluated on a test-by-test basis using information stored in
  the result files (<a name="jtr"><code>.jtr</code></a>) that are written in
  the work directory. Unless overridden by a test suite, a result file is written
  in the work directory for every test that is executed. When you change work
  directories between test runs, the result files in the previous work directory
  are no longer used and, if the new work directory is empty, the harness
  behaves as though each test in the test suite was not run.</p>

<p>
You can also use the Prior Status setting in combination with the Current Configuration
  view filter to display only those test and folder status icons that match the
  specified prior status. The test tree displays all other tests and folders
  as gray, filtered out <IMG SRC="../../images/grayFolder.gif" ALT="Filtered out folder"  longdesc="../browse/folderIcons.html"> folder
  and <IMG SRC="../../images/grayTest.gif" ALT="Test Filtered Out" longdesc="../browse/testIcons.html"> test
  icons. During a test run, when a test result no
  longer matches the prior status filter, the test tree changes the test and
  folder icons to gray, filtered out <IMG SRC="../../images/grayFolder.gif" ALT="Filtered out folder"  longdesc="../browse/folderIcons.html"> folder
  and <IMG SRC="../../images/grayTest.gif" ALT="Test Filtered Out" longdesc="../browse/testIcons.html"> test
  icons.</p>

<p>
For example, if you only want to monitor  tests in a test suite that had failed
  results you would set the Prior Status filter to Any Of Failed and repeat
  the test run. As tests pass, the test tree changes their icons from failed
  to filtered out, indicating
that they no longer match the Prior Status filter Any Of Failed.</p>

<!--CopyOn-->
It is often useful to choose all of the status values except Passed for the first
few test runs, then refine the filtering to reduce the number of tests in subsequent
runs.</p>
