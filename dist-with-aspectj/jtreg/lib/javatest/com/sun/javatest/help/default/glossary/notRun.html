<p class="glossText">&nbsp;&nbsp;
The test is not filtered out but the JT harness has not yet run it.
</p>

<p class="glossText">&nbsp;&nbsp;
The JT harness displays Not Run icons for tests that have not <em>yet</em> been
run. Folders containing tests that have not been run are displayed with the Not
Run icon only when they do not also contain tests or folders with <a href="error.html">Error</a> or <a href="fail.html">Failed</a> results.
