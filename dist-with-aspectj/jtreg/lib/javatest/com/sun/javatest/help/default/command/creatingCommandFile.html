<H1>Creating a Command File</H1>
<P>Use the single string arguments format style to write commands in a text file. See <a href="formatCommands.html">Formatting a Command</A> for detailed information.</P>
<P>Command files can contain blank lines and comments as well as lines with commands
  and their arguments. The following table describes the contents of a command
  file.</P>
	<TABLE width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="3" class="gray" summary="The contents and description of command files." title="Command File Contents">
		<TR valign="top">
			<TH width="20%" scope="col">File Contents
			</TH>
			<TH scope="col">Description
			</TH>
		</TR>
		<TR valign="top">
			<TD width="20%">Comments
			</TD>
			<TD>Comments can begin anywhere on a line, are started by the pound symbol ( #), and stop at the end of the line.
<P>Example:<BR>
			<CODE>#File contains commands</CODE></P>
			</TD>
		</TR>
		<TR valign="top">
			<TD>Commands
			</TD>
			<TD>Commands are executed in the sequence that they appear in the file (for example, setup commands must precede task commands). Commands used in the file must be separated by a semicolon (;) or a new line symbol (#). The # symbol acts as a new line character and can terminate a command.
<P>Examples:<BR>
			<CODE>open</code> <em>default</em><code>.jti; #opens file</CODE><BR>
			<CODE>-set host</code> <em>mymachine</em></P>
			</TD>
		</TR>
		<TR valign="top">
			<TD>Command Arguments
			</TD>
			<TD>Arguments that contain white space must be placed inside quotes. Use a backslash (\) to escape special characters such as quotes (" ") and backslashes (\).
			</TD>
		</TR>
	</TABLE>

<P>After writing the commands, use a descriptive name and the extension <CODE>.jtb</CODE> to save the text file. Choose a file name that helps you identify the function of each command file.</P>
