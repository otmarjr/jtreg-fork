<h1>Test Run Details Pane</h1>

<p>
Click the Test Run Details tab to display a two-column table of name-value pairs
  that were recorded when the test was run and may provide valuable information
  when troubleshooting a test run.
  Refer to your test suite documentation for detailed descriptions
of the result property name-value pairs for your test.</p>

<a name="detailsTab.name"><!-- index:Test Manager window: Test Run Details tab: property names --></a>
<h2>Name</h2>

<p>
The harness derives property names from the test results file and displays them in the table with the following defaults:
</p>


<ul>
<li>
Information about the version of the harness used to run the test
</li>
<li>
Information about the operating system used to run the test
</li>
<li>
Date and time the test started
</li>
<li>
Date and time the test ended
</li>
<li>
Additional details recorded by the test script used to run the test
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Because the properties listed in the table are a function of the test that you are running, the contents vary for each test suite.
</p>

<p>
Information written by commands, tests, and scripts as they are executing is
  displayed in the Test Run Messages pane.
</p>

<a name="detailsTab.value"><!-- index:Test Manager window: Test Run Details tab: values --></a>
<h2>Value</h2>

<p>
The values displayed in the table are from the test results file created by the
  harness after running the test.
