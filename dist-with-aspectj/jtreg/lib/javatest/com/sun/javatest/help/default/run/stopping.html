<h1>Stopping a Test Run</h1>
<p>
When the harness is running tests, it enables both the <IMG SRC="../../images/stopTests_button.gif"  ALT="Stop Test Run button displayed on the tool bar" longdesc="stopping.html"> &nbsp; button
on the toolbar and the Stop menu item.</p>

<p>
Either click the <IMG SRC="../../images/stopTests_button.gif"  ALT="Stop Test Run button displayed on the tool bar" longdesc="stopping.html"> &nbsp; button
or choose Run Tests <tt>&gt;</tt> Stop to stop a test run.</p>

<p>
As it completes each test, the harness writes the test results (<code>.jtr</code> files)
in the work directory. Stopping a test run causes the tests in progress to indicate
an error.</p>

<p>
When you stop a test run, the harness does not generate reports of test
  results. You must generate the reports from the Test Manager window or from
  the command line. See <a href="../report/usingReports.html">Creating and Displaying Reports</a> for
  detailed information about test reports.</p>
