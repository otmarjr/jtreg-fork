<h1>Viewing Configuration Values </h1>
<p>
The Test Environment browser displays the configuration values used to run a test suite. 
</p>

<center>
<img src="../../images/envwindow.gif" border="0" alt="the Test Environment dialog box" longdesc="dialog.html">
</center>

<p>
To open the Test Environment browser,  choose
  View <b>&gt;</b> Configure <b>&gt;</b> Show
Test Environment
from the Test Manager menu bar.</p>

<p>
The Test Environment browser contains a four-column table that displays information
  derived from the configuration file and used in configuring the test run. Useful
  features of the Test Environment browser include the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Click and drag
        the column headers or their separators to rearrange the order and change
      the size of the columns. </li>
  <li>Click inside a table cell to display its contents
        in the text box below the table. This
      is a useful feature when the contents of a cell are too long for the
    table to effectively display them.</li>
  <li> Click
      a column header to alpha-numerically sort the contents of the table. This
      is a useful feature when searching for a specific name or value in a lengthy
      table.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The following table describes the contents of the Test Environment browser.</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="3" class="gray" summary="The contents and description of the Test Environment dialog box." title="Test Environment Dialog Box Contents">
