<p><!--CopyOff--><img src="../../images/hg_proc.gif" alt="This is the start of a procedure" longdesc="setMarkers.html"><!--CopyOn-->To
  create a template, perform
  the following steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li> Choose Configure <b>&gt;</b> New
    Template from the Test Manager menu bar.</li>
  <li> Answer the questions displayed
    in the Template Editor.<br><br>The Template Editor  displays questions in the center pane (the
    Question Pane). After
    answering a question, click the Next button to proceed to the next question.</li>
</ol>

<!--
<ol start="3">
  <li> If a user is only expected to answer or change the values of certain questions,
    enable the Bookmarks in the menu and mark the questions that a user is expected
    to answer.<br><br>Use Bookmarks to simplify a configuration template by
      displaying only the questions that require information from the user. Normally
      long interviews can often be reduced to a small set of required questions
      through the effective use of Bookmarks within a configuration template. See <a href="setMarkersTE.html">Setting Bookmarks</a> for a detailed description of  the Bookmarks function.</li>
</ol>

<ol start="4">
  <li> Choose Bookmarks <b>&gt;</b> Show
    Only Marked Questions from the menu bar to display only the questions that
    have bookmarks. <br><br>Examine the results and verify that the bookmarked questions are the minimum
    set of questions a user must answer. These questions are what the user
    sees when the template is loaded in the Configuration Editor.</li>
</ol>

-->
<ol start="3">
  <li> Choose File <b>&gt;</b> Save As from the menu bar and save the template
    with a relevant name. <br><br>Template file names are automatically appended with a <code>.jtm</code> extension.</li>
</ol>

   <!--CopyOff-->
  <p>An optional  feature enables template updates to propagate
    (flow) to all of the configurations that are based on the template. When
    template propagation is enabled, the  harness checks for template
  updates when a user does any of the following actions:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Starts a test run</li>
    <li>Opens a work directory</li>
    <li>Loads a configuration</li>
  </ul>
  <!--CopyOn-->

<p class="note"><!--CopyOff--><IMG SRC="../../images/hg_note.gif" ALT="The following text is a Note" longdesc="createTemplate.html"><br><!--CopyOn-->
  Changes to a  template propagate to configurations based on the
  template <em>only</em> if propagation is enabled in both the template and the
  derived configurations.</p>
