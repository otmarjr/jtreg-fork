<H1>Monitoring Output Logs</H1>

<p>You can use the Log Viewer to monitor logs produced during a test
  run. To use the Log Viewer, your test suite must generate the logs that the
  viewer can display. See your test suite documentation
  for detailed information about the log files that it generates. See <a href="../ui/logViewer.html">Log Viewer</a>  for a detailed description of the Log Viewer.</p>

  <p>The Log Viewer enables you to perform the following actions when monitoring output logs:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Display specific types of information from a  log 
      by selecting one or more notification levels.
    <p>For example, you can choose to display only the Critical and Warning
      messages.</p>
  </li>
    <li>Monitor real-time content of output logs.
    <p>You can track log data in real time by selecting the Live Scrolling check
      box.</p>
</li>
      <li>Search log messages for text strings.
      <p>You can use the Find text field to search for literal strings within
        the currently viewed log data.</p>
     </li>
      <li>Display multiple views of real-time content.
      <p>You can display data side-by-side by clicking the Open New Log Viewer
        button and
        using different criteria for displaying the output data in each viewer.
        Only the first instance of the Log Viewer is used to restore log viewing
        preferences next time the work directory is opened.</p>
    </li>
      <li>Selection of log levels across all available logs in a single action.
      <p>Use the Selection Actions list to turn on a log level
        in all available logs. For example, you can turn on Error reporting
        for all logs. Because the operation only affects the current logs, logs
        created after you make the selection are not affected. To include logs created after the initial selection, reselect the action.</p>

</li>
<li>Save log contents displayed in the log viewer. To save the log contents, click the Save button at the bottom of the viewer.
</li>
<li>Clear the contents displayed in the log viewer. To clear the log contents, click the Clear log button at the bottom of the viewer.
</li>
</ul>
