<P>When using <code>EditJTI</code> to change the values in a configuration, you
can use either of the following command formats:</P>
	<ul>
	  <li>Use<EM> tag=value</EM> for direct replacement of values. You must know
		    the <I>tag-name</I> for
		    the question that sets the value.</li>
	  <li>Use<EM> /old pattern/new pattern/</EM> to replace all occurrences
		      (strings) of an old pattern to a new pattern. This format replaces
	        all occurrences in the file.</li>
</ul>
	<P>When using the <EM>/old pattern/new pattern/</EM> format, the separator can be any character. However, the string should be enclosed in quotes to avoid shell problems.</P>
<P>
<CODE>"|/java/jdk/1.3/|/java/jck/1.4/|"</CODE></P>
<P class="note"><!--CopyOff--><IMG src="../../images/hg_note.gif" alt="The following text is a note" longdesc="editFile.html"><BR><!--CopyOn-->
To run the following examples of changing configuration values, you must replace
<EM>myoriginal</EM><CODE>.jti</CODE> with a <CODE>.jti</CODE> file name that exists on your system. Win32 users must also replace the / file separators with \ file separators to run these examples.</P>
<P>Example:<BR>
<CODE>java -cp </CODE>[<EM>jt_dir</EM><CODE>/lib/</CODE>]<CODE>javatest.jar com.sun.javatest.EditJTI -o</CODE> <EM>mynew</EM><CODE>.jti "|/java/jdk/1.3/|/java/jck/1.4/|"</CODE> <EM>myoriginal</EM><CODE>.jti</CODE></P>
