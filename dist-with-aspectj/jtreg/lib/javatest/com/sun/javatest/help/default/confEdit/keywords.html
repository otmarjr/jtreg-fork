The following table provides descriptions and examples of keyword expressions
  that can be constructed.</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="5"  class="gray" summary="The contents and description of the keyword expressions that can be constructed." title="Keyword Expressions">
<tr valign="top">
<th width="25%" scope="col" class="left">Expression</th>
<th scope="col" class="left">
Description</th>
</tr>

<tr valign="top">
<td width="25%">Any Of</td>
<td>
Runs all tests in the test suite having any of the keywords entered in the text field.

<p>
Example:<br>

A test suite uses the keyword <code>interactive</code> to identify tests that
require human interaction, and <code>color</code> to identify tests that require a color display.</p>

<p>
To execute only the tests containing the <code>interactive</code> keyword, choose Any Of and then use the Insert Keyword button to choose the <code>interactive</code> keyword.</p></td>
</tr>

<tr valign="top">
<td width="25%">All Of</td>
<td>
Runs all tests in the test suite having all of the keywords entered in the text field.
<p>
Example:<br>

To execute only the tests containing both the <code>interactive</code> and <code>color</code> keywords,
choose All Of and then use the Insert Keyword button to choose the <code>interactive</code> and <code>color</code> keyword.</p></td>
</tr>

<tr valign="top">
<td width="25%">Expression</td>
<td>
Runs all tests in the test suite having the expression entered in the text field.

<p>
Use the Insert Keyword and the Insert Operator buttons to construct a Boolean
  expression in the text field. Keywords stand as Boolean predicates that are
  true if, and only if, the keyword is present in the test being considered.
  A test is accepted if the overall value of the expression is true.
All other tests are rejected by the restriction.</p>
<p>
Example:<br>

A test suite uses the keyword <code>interactive</code> to identify tests that require human
  interaction, and <code>color</code> to identify tests that require a color display.</p>

<p>
To execute only the tests with the <code>color</code> keyword that do not also
contain the
  <code>interactive</code> keyword, choose Expression and then  use the Insert
  Keyword button to choose the <code>color</code> keyword, the  Insert Operator
  button to choose the ! operator, and the Insert Keyword button to
  choose the <code>interactive</code> keyword.</p></td>

<h2>List of Logical Operators</h2>
<p>Logical operators are only available when Expression is selected in the list of expressions. The following table provides descriptions and examples of logical operators that can be used to build keyword expressions. The precedence column indicates the order in which the expression is resolved. Expressions in parentheses are evaluated first, with  nested parentheses being evaluated from the innermost parentheses outward. </p>

<td><p>Used to create groups of expressions.</p>
  <p>Example:<br>
A test suite uses the keyword <code>interactive</code> to identify tests that
require human interaction and <code>color</code> to identify tests that require
a color display. </p>
  <p><code>!(interactive&amp;color)</code>
  <p>The harness will exclude tests that include both keywords.  </td>

<tr valign="top">
  <td>! not </td><td>2</td>
  <td>Logical not. Used to exclude tests containing the expression.    <p> Example:<br>
      A test suite uses the keyword <code>interactive</code> to identify tests
      that require human interaction and <code>color</code> to identify tests
      that require a color display.     
    <p><code>!interactive&amp;!color</code>    
    <p>The harness will exclude tests that include
    either keyword.  </td>
</tr>

<tr valign="top">
<td >&amp; and </td><td>3</td>
<td>Logical and. Used to combine expressions.  <p>
Example:<br>

A test suite uses the keyword <code>interactive</code> to identify tests that
require human interaction and <code>color</code> to identify tests that require
a color display. </p>
  <p><code>interactive&amp;</code>color</p>
  <p>The harness will only choose tests that include both keywords.</p></td>
</tr>

<tr valign="top">
<td>| or </td><td>4</td>
<td>Logical or. Used to specify either of two expressions.  <p>
Example:<br>
A test suite uses the keyword <code>interactive</code> to identify tests that
  require human interaction and <code>color</code> to identify tests that require
  a color display.   
  <p><code>interactive|</code>color  
  <p>The harness will only choose tests that include either keyword.</td>
