<H1>Command-Line Summary</H1>
<P>You can use commands in the command line or as a part of a product build process to configure the harness, run tests, write test reports, and start the GUI using specific configuration values.</P>
<P>The harness executes the commands from left to right in the sequence that they appear in the command string. Include commands in the command string as though you were writing a script. The harness does not restrict either the number of commands or the groups of commands that you can use in a command string.</P>

<P>The commands are included as a formatted set in the following sequence:</P>
<OL>
		<LI><A href="setupCommands.html">Setup commands</A> - Required by task commands
		  to set values used for the test run and to set specific values used when
		  performing other tasks. Setup commands must precede the task or desktop
		  commands. Setup commands can be used to set specific values (without a task
		  command) when starting the GUI.</LI>
		<LI><A href="taskCommands.html">Task commands</A> - Required to run tests,
		  and write reports. Task commands require one or more preceding
		  setup commands.</LI>
		<LI><A href="desktopCommands.html">Desktop commands</A> - Use in place of the
		  task commands to start the GUI with a new desktop or to specify status colors
		  used in the GUI. Setup commands are optional when using Desktop commands.</LI>
		<LI><A href="displayHelp.html">Information Commands</A> - Use information commands
		  to display command-line help, online help, or version information without
		  starting the harness. Information commands do not require any other commands
		  on the command line.</LI>
</OL>
