<h1>Displaying Folder Information</h1>

<p>
The folder view contains filtered summary and status information about the tests in a test folder. This information is displayed both as values and as a pie chart. The folder view and test tree use the same view filter when displaying information. 
</p>

<p>To display the folder view, click a folder icon in the test tree. The folder view displays a Summary tab, a Documentation tab, five status tabs, and a status display.</p>

<center>
<img src="../../images/JT4infoArea.gif" alt="Information pane, folder view" border="0" longdesc="folderInfo.html">
</center>

<p>
During a test run, you can use the folder view to monitor the status of a folder and its tests. You can also use the folder view during troubleshooting to quickly locate and open individual tests that had errors or failed during the test run. When a status pane is empty, the harness disables its tab.
</p>

<p>
See <a href="summaryTab.html">Summary Information</a> for a description of the information displayed in the Summary pane.
</p>
		<p>The Documentation tab displays test suite documentation, assuming the test suite developer has provided it. In the test tree, select a test (not a folder) to display its description, if any, in the Documentation tab.</p>
		<p>
See <a href="statusTabs.html">Status Information</a> for a description of the folder information displayed by clicking the following status tabs:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<IMG SRC="../../images/greenTest.gif" ALT="Passed folder" longdesc="folderInfo.html">Passed (green with a check mark)
</li>
<li>
<IMG SRC="../../images/redTest.gif" ALT="Failed folder" longdesc="folderInfo.html">Failed (red with an x)
</li>
<li>
<IMG SRC="../../images/blueTest.gif" ALT="Error folder" longdesc="folderInfo.html">Error
(blue with an exclamation point)
</li>
<li>
<IMG SRC="../../images/whiteTest.gif" ALT="Not Run folder" longdesc="folderInfo.html">Not Run (white with a dash)
</li>
<li>
<IMG SRC="../../images/grayTest.gif" ALT="Filtered Out folder" longdesc="folderInfo.html">Filtered Out (gray or shaded)
</li>
</ul>

<p>
The status message displayed at the bottom of the pane provides information about
  the selected tab. The messages indicate that tests in the folder are loading
  or  provide detailed status information about a selected test.
