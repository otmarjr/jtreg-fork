<h1>Test Description Pane</h1>

<p>
Click the Test Description tab to display a two-column table of name-value
  pairs derived from the test descriptions cached in the work directory. Each
  test in a test suite has a test description.</p>
  <center><img src="../../images/JT4testDescriptionTab.gif" alt="Test description tab" longdesc="testDescriptionTab.html"></center>

  <p>
When you open the test suite in the harness, the test finder reads the
  test descriptions and caches them in the work directory. Test descriptions
  in the cache and the Test Description pane are not updated until you close
  and reopen the test suite. Refer to your test suite documentation for detailed
  descriptions of the names and values displayed in the Test Description pane.</p>

<h2>Name</h2>
<p>
The names displayed in the table identify the attributes and properties contained
  in the test description.</p>

<h2>Value</h2>
<p>
The values displayed in the table are the attribute and property values that the harness used to run the test. The values are read from the files in the test suite.</p>
