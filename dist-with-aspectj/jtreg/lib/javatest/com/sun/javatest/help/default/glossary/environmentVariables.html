<h1 class="glossTerm">Environment Entry</h1>

<p class="glossText">&nbsp;&nbsp;
A name-value pair derived from a configuration file and used by test suite specific
  plugin code to execute and run tests. These name-value pairs provide information
  (<a href="configurationValues.html">configuration values</a>) about how to
  run tests of a test suite on a particular platform.
</p>
		<p class="glossText">&nbsp;&nbsp;
For legacy test suites, the name-value pairs
  are read from an <a href="environmentFiles.html">environment file</a> (<code>.jte</code>) and derived from the  <a href="interviewFile.html">configuration file</a> (<code>.jti</code>). Current test suites do not use or support the environment file.</p>
