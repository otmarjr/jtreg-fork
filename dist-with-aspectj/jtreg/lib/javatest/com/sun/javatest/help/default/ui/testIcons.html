<h1>Test Icons</h1>

<p>
The test tree uses colored icons to indicate both run status and result status.
  The colors of the icons shown below are the default settings.
  The  harness enables you to use colors other than the default settings.
  See 
  <a href="../command/settingColors.html">Specifying
  Status Colors</a> in the <em>Command-Line Interface</em><em> User's Guide</em>.</p>

<a name="testIcons.runstatus"><!--index:test run status icon -->
  <!-- index:icons: test: run status--></a>
<h2>Test Run Status</h2>
<p>
The Test Manager displays an arrow to the left of the test icon when running a test. The standard values of the current configuration, not the view filter, determine the run status displayed by the test tree.
</p>

<a name="testIcons.Testresultstatus"><!--index:test result status icon -->
  <!-- index:icons: test: result status--></a>
<h2>Test Result Status</h2>
<p>
The test icon indicates the last known test result and does not change until the test is completed. After the  harness completes the test, it displays the appropriate result status icon.
</p>
<p>
The test result icons displayed in the test tree are determined by the results
  in the work directory and by the view filter set in the Test Manager.
  See <a href="../browse/viewFilters.html">View Filters</a> for a description
  of how to specify the test results displayed in the test tree. The following
  table describes the test icons used to indicate
  the result of each test.</p>

<p class="note">

Users can change the color of the test icons displayed in the following table. However, the symbols displayed in the icons do not change.

A blue test containing an exclamation symbol ( <b>!</b>)  indicates that
the test is not filtered out and that  harness could not execute it.
These errors usually occur because the test environment is not properly configured.</td>
