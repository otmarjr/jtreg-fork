<h1>Troubleshooting a Test Run</h1>

<p>
Normally, the goal of a test run is for all tests in the test suite that are
  not filtered out by the current configuration to have passing results. See <a href="../confEdit/editConfiguration.html">Changing
  Configuration Values</a> for a description of how the current configuration
  filters tests in a test run.</p>
<p>
If the root test suite folder contains tests with errors or failing results,
  you must troubleshoot and correct the cause to satisfactorily complete the
  test run.</p>

<p>
Tests with errors <IMG SRC="../../images/blueTest.gif" ALT="Tests with errors icon" longdesc="../browse/testIcons.html"> are
tests that could not be executed by the JT harness. These errors usually
occur because the test environment is not properly configured or the software
under test is defective. See <a href="../concepts/troubleshooting.html#troubleshooting.errors">Tests
with Errors</a> for a detailed description of troubleshooting tests with errors.</p>

<p>
Tests that failed <IMG SRC="../../images/redTest.gif" ALT="Tests that failed" longdesc="../browse/testIcons.html"> are
tests that were executed but had failing results. See <a href="../concepts/troubleshooting.html#troubleshooting.failed">Tests
that Fail</a> for a detailed description of troubleshooting tests that failed.</p>

<p>
The Test Manager window provides you with the following facilities to effectively troubleshoot a test run:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Test Tree
</li>
<li>
Folder View
</li>
<li>
Test View
</li>
<li>
Log Viewer
</li>
<li>Service Monitor</li>
</ul>

<h2>Test Tree</h2>
<p>
Use the test tree and view
filters to identify specific folders and tests with errors or failing
results. Open the red <IMG SRC="../../images/redFolder.gif" ALT="Failed folder" longdesc="../browse/folderIcons.html"> and
blue <IMG SRC="../../images/blueFolder.gif" ALT="Error folder" longdesc="../browse/folderIcons.html">folders
until the specific tests that failed <IMG SRC="../../images/redTest.gif" ALT="Tests that failed" longdesc="../browse/folderIcons.html"> or
had errors <IMG SRC="../../images/blueTest.gif" ALT="Tests with errors icon" longdesc="../browse/folderIcons.html"> are
displayed.</p>

<h2>Folder View</h2>
<p>
When you click a folder icon in the test
tree pane, the JT harness displays a filtered summary of its test status
in the Test Manager information area that matches the test tree.</p>

<p class="note"><!--CopyOff--><IMG SRC="../../images/hg_note.gif" ALT="The following text is a note" longdesc="troubleshooting.html">
<br>
<!--CopyOn-->
The View filter chosen in the Test Manager window might change the summary values
displayed in the folder view, but does not change the test results written in
the work directory.</p>

<p>
Click the Error and the Failed tabs to display the lists of all tests in and
  under a folder that were not successfully run. You can double-click a test
  in the lists to view its detailed test information. Refer to Test View below
  for a description of the test information that the JT harness displays.</p>

<h2>Test View</h2>

<p>
When you click a test icon in the test tree or double-click its name in the folder
  view, the JT harness displays unfiltered, detailed information about
  the test in the information area. The Test Manager displays the current information
  for that test from the work directory.</p>

<p class="note">
<!--CopyOff--><IMG SRC="../../images/hg_note.gif" ALT="The following text is a note" longdesc="troubleshooting.html">
<br>
<!--CopyOn-->
Because the Test Manager does not use a view filter when displaying test information,
the test status displayed in the information area may not match the filtered
view in the test tree or the folder Summary view.</p>
 
<p>
The test view contains detailed test information panes and a brief status message at the bottom identifying the type of result. This message may be sufficient for you to identify the cause of an error or failure.
</p>

<p>
If you need additional information to identify the cause of the error or failure, use the following panes listed in order of their importance:
</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="../browse/messagesTab.html">Test Run Messages</a> contains a Message list and a Message pane that display the messages produced during the test run
</li>

<li><a href="../browse/detailsTab.html">Test Run Details</a> contains a two-column
  table of name-value pairs recorded when the test was run.
</li>

<li><a href="../browse/configurationTab.html">Configuration</a> contains a two-column
  table of the name-value pairs derived from the configuration data that were
  actually used to run the test. 
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Log Viewer</h2>
<p>
Use the Log Viewer (select View > Logs) to monitor log files generated during a test run or to inspect log files after a test run is completed. See <a href="../run/logViewer.html">Monitoring Output Logs</a> for a detailed description. </p>

<h2>Service Monitor</h2>
<p>If a test suite uses services, use the Service Monitor (select View &gt; Services) to see the status of services. See <a href="../run/svcViewer.html">Monitoring Services</a> for a detailed description.
