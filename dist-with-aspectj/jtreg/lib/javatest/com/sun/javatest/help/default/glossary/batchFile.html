<h1 class="glossTerm">Command File</h1>

<p class="glossText">&nbsp;&nbsp;
You can place routinely used configuration settings in a command file and include it in a command line. The command file is an ASCII file containing a lengthy series of commands and their arguments used in the command-line interface to modify specific configuration values before running tests.
</p>
<p class="glossText">&nbsp;&nbsp;
You can use command files to configure and run tests, and write test reports either from the command line or as a part of a product build process.  Using a command file allows you to repeatedly use a configuration without retyping the commands each time a test run is performed.
</p>

<p class="glossText">&nbsp;&nbsp;
It is recommended that a descriptive name and the extension <code>.jtb</code> are used to help identify the function of each command file.
