</center>


<p>Clicking OK saves all changes. Clicking Cancel closes the dialog and negates any changes you have made and closes the dialog. Clicking Restore Defaults brings back the default settings without closing the dialog.</p>
<ul>
  <li>To choose a color swatch click the  Swatches tab, and click a swatch. The Preview area shows the possible use of the color in a text field. Once a color has been selected, the block on the right shows the original value on the top, and the current value on the bottom. Clicking OK applies your change and closes the dialog. Clicking Cancel closes the dialog without changes. Clicking Reset restores the original value without closing the dialog. <br>
