To set the concurrency and the timeout factor, perform the following steps:</p>


  <ol>
    <li>Click the <img src="../../images/stdValues_button.gif" alt="QuickSet Mode button" width="10" height="11" longdesc="toolBar.html"> Quick
      Set Mode button on the Test Manager tool bar, choose Configure
      &gt; Edit Quick Set &gt; Concurrency, or choose Configure
      &gt; Edit Quick Set &gt; Timeout Factor in the menu bar.</li>
  </ol>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The Configuration Editor opens in Quick Set Mode.</p>

You can also use the Configuration Editor window in Question Mode to specify the concurrency and the timeout factor.</p>
<ol start="2">
  <li>Click the Execution tab if it does not have focus.</li>
  <li>Use the text fields in the tabbed pane to set the concurrency
    and the timeout factor values used to run tests in your computing environment.</li>

<A NAME="execution.concurrency"><!-- index:Question Mode view: setting: concurrency; setting: concurrency --></a>
<h2>Concurrency</h2>
<p>
The harness can run tests concurrently. If you are running the tests
  on a multiprocessor computer or are using multiple agents on a test system,
  concurrency can reduce the time required to run tests. For detailed information
  about using agents to run tests, refer to 
<!--<a href="../agent/usingAgents.html">JT Harness Agent</a>-->
 your test suite
documentation and to the <em>JT Harness Agent User's Guide</em> if it is
provided by the test suite.</p>

<p> 
When using multiple agents to run tests, the concurrency value must not exceed
  the number of agents. If the concurrency value exceeds the total number of
  available agents, an error will occur in the test run.</p>
<p>
If you have unexpected test failures, run the tests again, one at a time. Some
  test suites may not work correctly if you run tests concurrently. The default
  range of values used by the harness is from <code>1</code> to <code>50</code>.</p>
<p>
For your first test run,  leave this field set to <code>1</code>. After the tests
run properly, you can increase this value. Unless your test
suite restricts concurrency, the maximum <em>number</em> of threads
specified by the <code>concurrency</code> command is <code>50</code>. See your test suite
documentation for additional information about using concurrency values greater
than <code>1</code>.</p>
<p>
This field is disabled for some test suites.</p>
<A NAME="execution.timeFactor"><!-- index:Question Mode view: setting: time factor -->
  <!-- index:setting: time factor --></a>
<h2>Time Factor</h2>
<p>
To prevent a stalled test from stopping a test run, most test suites set a timeout
  limit for each test. The timeout limit is the amount of time that the harness waits for a test to complete before moving on to the next test.</p>
<p>
If you are running the tests on a particularly slow CPU or slow network, you
  can change the time limit by specifying a floating point value in the time
  factor field. Each test's timeout limit is multiplied by the time factor value.
  The default range of values used by the harness is from <code>0.1</code> to <code>100.0</code>.</p>
<p class="note">
<!--CopyOff--><IMG SRC="../../images/hg_note.gif" ALT="The following text is a note" longdesc="overview.html">
<br>
<!--CopyOn-->
In the Time Factor field, the harness uses the form of floating point
values that is specific to the locale in which it is run. For example, if your
locale uses floating point values in the form of <code>x,x</code>, harness
uses that form of floating point value in the Time Factor field. In setting the
timeout factor in the following example, specify values of <code>2,0</code> and <code>0,5</code> if
your locale uses floating
point values in the form of <code>x,x</code>. </p>
<p>
Example:</p>
<p>
If you specify a value of <code>2.0</code>, the timeout limit for tests with
a basic 10-minute time limit becomes 20 minutes. Specifying a value of <code>0.5</code> for
tests with a 10-minute limit produces a 5-minute timeout limit.</p>
<p>
At first, use the default value of <code>1.0</code> to run tests and then, if
necessary, increase the value. The actual timeout calculation for any particular
test suite might vary.</p>
