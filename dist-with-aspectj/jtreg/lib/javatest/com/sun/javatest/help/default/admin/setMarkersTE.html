<H1>Setting Bookmarks</H1>

<p>
You can use Bookmarks to restrict the set of questions displayed when a user
  loads the template in a Configuration Editor. This feature enables
  you to reduce the visible length and complexity of a configuration interview
  by only displaying the questions that a user must answer before running tests.</p>
<p>Bookmarks are persistent and are saved in the <code>.jtm</code> file. If bookmarks
  are disabled by a user, they remain in program memory but cannot be manipulated.</p>
