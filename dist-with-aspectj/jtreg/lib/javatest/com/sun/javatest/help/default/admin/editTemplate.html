<h1>Editing a Template</h1>

<p>The Template Editor provides the
  following two modes of displaying and editing the questions and values in a
template. <br><br>See <a href="questionModeTE.html">Question Mode</a> for
    detailed information about using the features of this editing mode.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Question Mode - Enables editing of all template questions. </li>
</ul>
<!--insert:NoEditBuiltinTemplate-->


<ul>
  <li>Quick Set Mode - Enables rapid editing of a limited set of template  questions. <br><br>Quick Set Mode filters out all test suite specific questions and displays
    a limited set of general questions whose values are often changed from test
    run to test run. In this editing mode, the Template Editor creates logical
    groupings of the values and displays them in  tab form
    for easy user navigation and access.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="proc">Editing in  Question Mode</h2>

<p><!--CopyOff--><img src="../../images/hg_proc.gif" alt="This is the start of a procedure" longdesc="editTemplate.html"><!--CopyOn-->To
  edit all template questions and bookmarks in a template, perform
  the following steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>If you are editing the current template (named at the bottom of the Test Manager) choose Configure  &gt; Edit Template in the Test Manager menu bar, otherwise choose either Configure &gt; Load Template or Configure &gt; Load Recent Template. <br><br>If you are editing the current template (named at the bottom of the Test Manager), the harness opens the Template Editor and loads the template. Go to step 3. <br><br>If you are editing a different template, the harness displays the Load Template
    dialog box.</li>
</ol>

<ol start="2">
  <li>Use the dialog box to locate and load the template. <br><br>The harness
    opens the Template Editor and displays
    the template in Question Mode. </li>
</ol>

<ol start="3">
  <li>Use Question Mode to change the values of
    questions in the template. </li>

  <li>Click Done to save the changes and close the Template
  Editor.</li>
</ol>
<p>You can use the View menu at any time to change from one 
  mode to the next. Because there is only one template file loaded in the Template
  Editor at a time, when you change modes during an editing session,
  any changes  made in one mode are automatically reflected
  in the other.</p>

<p>If a configuration is attached to the edited template, the harness opens a Template updated dialog box that enables you to review the changes and to accept, reject, or postpone having the changes propagated to the attached configuration. See <a href="../templates/resolveConflicts.html">Resolving Configuration-Template Conflicts</a> for a description of the dialog box and the choices available to the user.
