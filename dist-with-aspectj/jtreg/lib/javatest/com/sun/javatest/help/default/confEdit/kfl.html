<H1 class="proc">Using Known Failures Lists</H1>
<p>A <i>known failures list</i> (KFL) is a user-authored text file with the extension <code>.kfl</code>. The KFL file lists tests in a test suite that are known to fail. The failing tests are identified by path names that uniquely identify test names and test cases. Known failures list files are maintained by users (they are not distributed as part of a test suite, unlike an exclude list). Currently the known failures information is used to generate and filter information in test reports. See the help topic <a href="../report/newReports.html#optKFL">KFL Options in HTML Reports</a> for more information on creating and using a known failures list.</p>
