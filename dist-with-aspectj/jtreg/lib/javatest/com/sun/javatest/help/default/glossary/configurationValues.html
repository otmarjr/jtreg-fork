<h1 class="glossTerm">Configuration Value</h1>

<p class="glossText">&nbsp;&nbsp;
A value specified by the user for the purpose of configuring a test run.
</p>
		<p class="glossText">&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Configuration values are derived from <a href="environmentVariables.html">environment entries </a> in a 
<a href="configurationFile.html">configuration file </a> (<tt>.jti</tt>) and used by test suite specific plugin code to execute and run tests.</p>
<p class="glossText">&nbsp;&nbsp;Use the <a href="configurationEditor.html">Configuration Editor </a> or
 <a href="editJTI.html"><code>EditJTI</code> </a> to change the configuration values in the <code>.jti</code> file.
You can also set specific configuration values in the command line.
</p>
<p class="glossText">&nbsp;&nbsp;For legacy test suites the configuration value is read from an <a href="environmentFiles.html">environment file </a> (<code>.jte</code>). Current test suites do not use or support the environment file.</p>
