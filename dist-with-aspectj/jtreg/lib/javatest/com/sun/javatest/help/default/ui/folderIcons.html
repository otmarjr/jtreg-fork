<h1>Folder Icons</h1> 

<p>
The test tree uses colored icons to indicate both run status and result status.
  The colors of the icons shown below are the  default settings.
  The harness enables you to use colors other than the default settings.
  See 
  <a href="../command/settingColors.html">Specifying
  Status Colors</a> in the <em>Command-Line Interface User's Guide</em>.</p>

<a name="folderIcons.runstatus"><!-- index:folder run status icon; icons: folder: run status --></a>
<h2>Folder Run Status</h2>
<p>
When activity occurs in a folder, such as loading or running tests, the Test Manager displays an arrow to the left of the folder icon. The standard values
  of the current configuration, not the view filter, determine the run status
  displayed by the test tree.
</p>

<a name="folderIcons.resultstatus"><!-- index:folder result status icon; icons: folder: result status --></a>
<h2>Folder Result Status</h2>
<p>
The folder icon indicates the current test results in the work directory and
  does not change until its tests are completed. After the harness completes
  running the tests in a folder, it displays the appropriate result status icon.</p>
<p> 
The folder icon displayed in the test tree is determined by the result of all
  its tests (see <a href="testIcons.html">Test Icons</a>) and the current view
  filter (see <a href="../browse/viewFilters.html">View Filters</a>). The folder
  icons displayed in the test tree indicate the highest priority result of any
  test hierarchically beneath it. The following table describes the folder icons
  in order of priority.</p>
