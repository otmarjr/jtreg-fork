<H1>Setting Concurrency with <CODE>concurrency</CODE></H1>
<!--insert:PreCurrency-->
<P>If you are running the tests on a multi-processor computer, you can use concurrency to speed your test runs. Use the <CODE>concurrency</CODE> command to specify the number of tests to run concurrently:</P>
<P class="indent2"><a href="aboutExamples.html"><em>&gt; jtharness</EM></A> ... [<EM>initial-set-up commands</EM>] ... <CODE>-concurrency</CODE> <EM>number</EM> ... [<EM>task-command</EM>] ...</P>
<P>See <a href="aboutExamples.html">About the Command-Line Examples</A> for a description of the use of <EM>&gt; jtharness</EM> in the example.</P>
<P>Unless your test suite restricts concurrency, the maximum <EM>number</EM> of
  threads specified by the <CODE>concurrency </CODE>command is 256. See your test
  suite documentation for additional information about using concurrency values
  greater than 1.</P>
<P>When creating a command string to specify the number of tests to run concurrently, include the commands in the following sequence:</P>
	<OL>
		<LI><A href="setupCommands.html">Set up a configuration</A></LI>
		<LI>Specify the concurrency value (<CODE>concurrency</CODE> <EM>number</EM>)</LI>
		<LI><A href="runTests.html">Include the <CODE>runtests</CODE> command</A> (optional).</LI>
	</OL>
<P>See <a href="commandLine.html">Command-Line Overview</A> for a description of the command line structure.</P>
<H2>Detailed Example of <code>concurrency</code> Command </H2>
<P>In the following example, <EM>myconfig</em><code>.jti</code> represents a
  file name that might exist on your system and value represents a numeric value
  from 1 to 256 that you might use.</P>
<P><B>Command Options Format Example:</B></P>
<P class="indent2"><a href="aboutExamples.html"><em>&gt; jtharness</EM></A> <CODE>-config</CODE> <EM>myconfig</em><code>.jti
    -concurrency</CODE> <EM>value</EM> <CODE>-runtests</CODE></P>
<P>See <a href="formatCommands.html">Formatting a Command</A> for descriptions and examples of other command formats.</P>
