To edit a configuration, perform the following steps:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Choose Configure <b>&gt;</b> Edit Configuration in the Test Manager menu bar. </li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
  <p>The harness opens the Configuration Editor in Question
    Mode and loads the current configuration.</p>
  <p>In Question Mode, 
    the Configuration Editor enables the Bookmarks feature.
    Use the Bookmarks feature to simplify an interview by displaying only 
  questions whose answers might change. See <a href="setMarkers.html">Using Bookmarks in Configurations</a> for
  the steps required to set, clear, and manage Bookmarks in a configuration.
  See <a href="fullViewDialog.html">Question Mode</a> for detailed information
  about using the features of this  mode to edit a configuration.</p>
  <p>Quick Set Mode enables rapid editing of frequently changed values.
    If you are editing only these values, you can change
    to the Quick Set Mode. You can use the View menu at any time to change
    from one  mode to the other. Because only one configuration
    file is loaded in the Configuration Editor at a time, any changes that you
    made in one mode are automatically reflected in the other mode. See <a href="editQuickSet.html">Editing
    Quick Set Values</A> for detailed information about using the features of
    this mode to edit a configuration.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="2">
  <li>In Question Mode, navigate to the question by one of the following means:  </li>
</ol>
  <ul>
    <li> Use the Search menu to locate specific characters or character strings
      in the titles, questions, and answers. See <a href="searchConfiguration.html">Searching a Configuration</A>.</li>
    <li> Choose the question directly from the Index
      pane.</li>
    <li> Click the Back button or Next button as required to locate the question.</li>
  </ul>
    <ol start="3">
      <li> Review and change configuration values as necessary. 
</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>
When you move backward
        and forward through the list of questions, the Configuration Editor preserves
      your previous answers until you change them.
</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="4">
    <li> After making all required changes to the configuration, save the changed
      configuration by one of the following means:</li>
</ol>
    <ul>
      <li>If you are using a configuration template or an existing configuration
        file to create a new configuration file, choose File <b>&gt;</b> Save
        As from the Configuration Editor menu bar. The Configuration Editor opens
        a dialog box for you to use in setting the location and name of the new
        configuration file.</li>
      <li>If you are modifying an existing configuration file used to run tests,
          click the Done button. The Configuration Editor saves the changes to
          the configuration file and closes. When the Done button is enabled, you
        can click it regardless of your location in the configuration.</li>
</ul>
