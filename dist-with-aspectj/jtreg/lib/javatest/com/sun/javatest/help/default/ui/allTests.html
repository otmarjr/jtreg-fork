<h1>All Tests View Filter</h1>
<p>
When you select the All Tests view filter, the Test Manager immediately displays current totals in the Summary pane and status icons in the test tree for all folders and tests, regardless of the values set in the configuration. This is an unfiltered view of the complete work directory contents.
</p>

<p>
The harness only overwrites the previous results for tests when they are rerun. The All Tests filter displays the last run status for all tests in the work directory, including the tests that were excluded from the current test run.
</p>

<p>
If you are using the All Tests view filter and begin a test run, the harness displays an advisory dialog box. Using the All Test view filter will display the results of all tests in a test suite regardless of whether or not they are included in the test run.
</p>
<p>
You can choose to disable the dialog box by setting preferences,
  by choosing a different view filter, or by using the check box in the dialog
  to stop the dialog from being displayed in the future. </p>
<p>The following examples
provide  descriptions of the use of the All Tests view filter. </p>
<ul>
  <li><b>
    Example 1
  -</b> A test run had failed tests and you want to rerun only the
  failed tests. See <a href="../confEdit/status.html">Specifying Prior Status</a> for
  a detailed description of setting the prior status value. The Test Tree and
  the Summary pane do not change.</li>
</ul>

</blockquote>
<ul>
  <li><b>
    Example 2
  -</b> A test run had failed tests and you want to use an Exclude
  List in the next run that excludes the failed tests from the test run. See <a href="../confEdit/excludeList.html">Using
  Exclude Lists</a> for a detailed description of specifying an exclude list.
  The Test Tree and the Summary pane do not change.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    When you repeat the test run, the Test Manager displays current status icons in the test tree and totals in the Summary pane for every test in the work directory, including results for any tests excluded from the current test run.
