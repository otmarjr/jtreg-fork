<h1>Displaying the Configuration Checklist</h1>

<p>
Your test suite might produce a checklist of steps that must be performed before
  running tests. The checklist is dynamically generated by the harness
  from the current configuration. Changes to the values in the current configuration
  can produce different checklist items.
</p>

<p>
If the tests suite produces a checklist, the harness enables the Show Checklist
  menu item. To view the Configuration Checklist of the current configuration
  interview choose View <b>&gt;</b> Configuration <b>&gt;</b> Show Checklist. 
</p>

<p>
To close both the Configuration Checklist and the viewer, click the Close button at the bottom of the window.
