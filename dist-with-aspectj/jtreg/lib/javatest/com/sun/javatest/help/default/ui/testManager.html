<li>Disable sort of Tests to Run when specified from input file: This allows you to set the test execution order. Traditionally tests are run in the order they appear in the main test tree.

That is, the tests will be executed in the  order they appear in that file, rather than being sorted and then executed. The default state of this checkbox is unchecked. See </li></ul>
