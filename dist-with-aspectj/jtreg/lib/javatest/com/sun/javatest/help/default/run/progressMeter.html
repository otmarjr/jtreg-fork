<h1>Progress Indicator</h1>
<p>
The progress indicator located at the bottom of the Information
Area displays the elapsed time of the previous test run when tests are not
running. When tests are running, it automatically changes to the progress bar
of the current test run. At the completion of the
test run, the indicator changes to display the elapsed time.</p>
<p>
You can use the <IMG SRC="../../images/drop-down.gif" ALT="drop-down list button" longdesc="progressMeter.html"> button
at any time to select and display either the elapsed
time or
the progress bar.</p>
<p><a name="progressMeter.time">
  <!-- index:Test Manager window: progress indicator: elapsed time-->
  <!-- index:progress indicator: elapsed time -->
</a></p>
<h2>Elapsed Time</h2>
<p>
When a test run starts, the elapsed time display resets to 00.00.00. At the end
  of the test run, the total elapsed time for the test run is displayed.</p>
<a name="progressMeter.bar"><!-- index:Test Manager window: progress indicator: progress bar -->
  <!-- index: progress indicator --></a>
<h2>Progress Bar</h2>
<p>
The harness displays a progress bar and a percentage complete value.
  As the  harness completes a test, it updates the progress
  bar and the percentage complete value.</p>
