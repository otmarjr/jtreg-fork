<p class="glossText">&nbsp;&nbsp;
Known Failures List (KFL) files (*<code>.kfl</code>), list tests that are known to fail. </p>
<p class="glossText">&nbsp;&nbsp;
The purpose  of this option is to enrich the reporting output so you can monitor the status of certain tests across test runs. If a KFL is specified, the HTML report includes a Known Failure Analysis section. This section provides hypertext links to the tests listed in the KFL. Also, if bug IDs are specified in the KFL the IDs are hypertext linked to a bug tracking system (specified as a URL in File &gt; Preferences &gt; Test Manager &gt; Reporting).</p>
<p class="glossText">&nbsp;&nbsp;One or more KFLs can be specified as a parameter in the configuration editor. KFLs can also be specified from the command line. </p>
