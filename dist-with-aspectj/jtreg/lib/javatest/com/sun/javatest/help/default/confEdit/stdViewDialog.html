<p>
Quick Set Mode uses tabbed panes to display the  values of a configuration
  that the harness uses  to determine which tests are run and how they are run.
  Because they  might change from test run to test run, the Quick Set
  Mode enables the user to quickly locate and edit these 
  values.</p>

<p>
Quick Set Mode
  displays only the values that apply to your test suite.Tabs
  containing  values that do not apply to your test suite are not displayed
   in Quick Set Mode. Depending on your test suite, Quick Set Mode can display
  four, five, or six tabbed panes and a menu bar.</p>
