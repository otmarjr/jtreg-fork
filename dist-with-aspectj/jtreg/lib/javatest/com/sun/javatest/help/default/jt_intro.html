<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>
The online User's Guide contains information about using the graphical
  user interface (GUI), the command-line interface, the harness utilities, and
  the optional JT harness agent (when it is included by the test suite).
  The online User's Guide provides a glossary, an index, and a search function
  that enables the user to locate any word or phrase used in the User's Guides.</p>
  <p>
Users can display the User's Guide with or without starting the GUI. To display
  the User's Guide without starting the GUI, type the following command from
  the directory where the <code>javatest.jar</code> file is located:</p>
  <p><code>java -jar javatest.jar -userGuide</code></p>
  <h2><IMG SRC="../images/closedbook.gif" ALT="The following text is a heading" longdesc="jt_intro.html">Graphical User Interface</h2>
<p>
This section describes how the GUI enables the user to:</p>

<ul>
<li>
Configure, run, and monitor tests.</li>
<li>
Create templates.</li>
<li>
Use the Quick Start to set up and run tests.</li>
<li>
Generate and view test reports.</li>
<li>
Monitor agents (Optional).</li>
</ul>


<h2><IMG SRC="../images/closedbook.gif" ALT="The following text is a heading" longdesc="jt_intro.html"> Command-Line Interface</h2>
<p>
This section describes how the command-line interface enables the user to:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Configure, run, and monitor tests.</li>
<li>
Generate and view test reports.</li>
<li>
Run tests in build scripts and other automated processes.</li>
<li>
Start the GUI in a specified configuration.</li>
</ul>


<h2><IMG SRC="../images/closedbook.gif" ALT="The following text is a heading" longdesc="jt_intro.html"> Utilities</h2>

<p>
This section describes how the utilities provided by the harness allow a user
  to perform the following basic tasks without starting the GUI:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Remotely monitor results with an HTTP server.
</li>
<li> 
Browse result files.
</li>
<li> 
Browse exclude list files.
</li>
<li> 
Edit entries in a configuration file.
</li>
<li> 
Move test reports.
</li>
</ul> 


<h2><IMG SRC="../images/closedbook.gif" ALT="The following text is a heading" longdesc="jt_intro.html"> Optional JT Harness Agent</h2> 


<p>The harness provides an optional agent that you can use when running test suites on small systems. In some cases, users might understand the term <em>agent</em> as including software components which are not part of the harness. However, in
  this documentation, the term <i>agent</i> refers to the JT Harness agent.
If a test suite uses this agent, the test suite might also include the agent user's guide in the harness.</p>
