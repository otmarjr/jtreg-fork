<H1>Setting Timeout With <CODE>timeoutFactor</CODE></H1>
<P>Each test in a test suite has a timeout limit. The  harness waits for a test
  to complete for the duration of that limit before moving on to the next test.
You can use the <CODE>timeoutFactor</CODE> command to change the timeout limit:</P>
<P class="indent2"><a href="aboutExamples.html"><EM>&gt; jtharness</EM></A> ... [<EM>initial-setup-commands</EM>] ... <CODE>-timeoutFactor</CODE> <EM>number</EM> ... [<EM>task-command</EM>] ...</P>
<P>See <a href="aboutExamples.html">About the Command-Line Examples</A> for a description of the use of <EM>&gt; jtharness</EM> in the example.</P> <P>See <a href="commandLine.html">Command-Line Overview</A> for a detailed description of the command-line structure.</P>
<P>Each test's timeout limit is multiplied by the time factor value. For example, if you specify a value of 2.0, the timeout limit for tests with a 10 basic time limit becomes 20 minutes. See <a href="formatCommands.html">Formatting a Command</A> for descriptions of the command formats. Note that the format of the value input for the timeout factor is dependant on the locale.</P>
<P>When creating a command string to change the timeout limit, include the commands in the following sequence:</P>
	<OL>
		<LI>Include the commands required to set up a configuration.</LI>
	</OL>
    <blockquote>
      <p>See <a href="setupCommands.html">Setup Commands</A> for detailed description
        of the available commands.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <ol start="2">
      <LI>Include the commands required to specify the timeout limit (<CODE>timeoutFactor</CODE> <EM>number</EM>).</LI>
      <LI>(Optional) Include the <CODE>runtests</CODE> command.</LI>
    </ol>
    <blockquote>
      <p>See <a href="runTests.html">Running Tests With <CODE>runtests</CODE></A> for a detailed description of the command.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <H2>Detailed Example of <code>timeFactor</code> Command </H2>
<P>In the following example, <EM>myconfig</em><code>.jti</code> and <EM>myexcludelist</eM><code>.jtx</code> represent
  file names that might exist on your system. </P>
<P><B>Command Options Format Example:</B></P>
<P class="indent2"><a href="aboutExamples.html"><EM>&gt; jtharness</EM></A> <CODE>-config</CODE> <EM>myconfig</em><code>.jti -timeoutFactor 2.0 -runtests</CODE></P>
<P>See <a href="formatCommands.html">Formatting a Command</A> for descriptions and examples of other command formats that you can use.</P>
