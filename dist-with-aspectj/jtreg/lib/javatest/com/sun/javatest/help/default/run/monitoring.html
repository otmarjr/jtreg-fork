<h1>Monitoring a Test Run</h1>
<p>After the test run begins, the Test Manager displays information about the test run in the areas described in the following table.</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="5" class="gray.wide" summary="The Test Manager window displays the progress of the test run." title="Monitor a Test Run">
<tr valign="top">
<th width="15%" scope="col" class="left">

<th scope="col" class="left">
Description
</th>
</tr>

<tr valign="top">
<td scope="row">
<p>Test Tree</p>
</td>
<td scope="row">
<p>The test tree uses colored icons to display the current run and test results
  status of the folders and tests in the work directory. As the harness
  completes running individual tests, it updates
  each test tree icon to indicate the test result status. </p>
  <p>See <a href="testTree.html">Monitoring With a Test Tree</a> for detailed information
about using the test tree to monitor the progress of the test run.</p></td>
</tr>

<tr valign="top">
<td scope="row"><p>Status Messages</p></td>
<td scope="row">
<p>Below the test tree area is a resizable text area that displays information about
  current Test Manager activity. In this area the harness displays status
  messages about the state of the test run and the name of the test being run.</p></td>
</tr>

<tr valign="top">
<td scope="row">
<p>Progress Indicator</p>
</td>
<td scope="row">
<p>The Test Manager Status Line contains a progress indicator. The indicator displays the elapsed time of the
previous test run when tests are not running. When tests are running, it automatically
changes to the progress bar of the current test run. At the completion of the
test run, the indicator changes to display the elapsed time.</p>
<p>
See <a href="progressMeter.html">Progress Indicator</a> for information about using the test progress meter to monitor the progress of the test run.</p></td>
</tr>

<tr valign="top">
<td scope="row">
Progress Monitor
</td>
<td scope="row">
<p>A separate Progress Monitor is available that displays current, detailed information about the progress of the test run.</p>

<p> 
See <a href="progressMonitor.html">Progress Monitor</a> for information about using the Progress Monitor.
</p>
</td>
</tr>

<tr valign="top">
<td scope="row">
<p>Information Area</p>
</td>
<td scope="row">
<p>As tests run, the harness displays information about the run in the information area to the right of the test tree. The information area provides two views:

<ul>
<li><p>Folder view - When you click a folder icon in the test tree, the harness displays a Summary tab, a Documentation tab, five status tabs, and a status field containing information from the work directory about a folder and its descendants. See <a href="../browse/folderInfo.html">Displaying Folder Information</A> for detailed information about browsing folder information.</p></li>
<li><p>Test view - When you click a test icon in the test tree or double click its name in the Folder view, the harness displays six tabbed panes that contain detailed information about the test. See <a href="../browse/testInfo.html">Displaying Test Information</A> for detailed information about browsing test information.</p></li>
</ul>
</td></p>
</tr>
</table>

<p>While monitoring the test run in the Test manager, you can also display the contents of output logs being generated during the test run. See <a href="logViewer.html">Monitoring Output Logs</a> and <a href="svcViewer.html">Monitoring Services</a> for detailed information.</p>
<p>The harness also provides a web server that you can use to remotely monitor and control batch mode test runs. The HTTP Server provides two types of output:</p>
<UL>
		<LI><p>HTML Formatted Output allowing users to remotely monitor batch mode test runs in a web browser</p></LI>
		<LI><p>Plain Text Output intended for use by automated testing frameworks</p></LI>
</UL>
<p>See the <em>Command-Line Interface User's Guide</em> for details about running tests from the command line and using the web server.</p>
