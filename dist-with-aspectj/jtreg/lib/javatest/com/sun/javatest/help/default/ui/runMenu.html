<h1>Run Tests Menu</h1>

<p>The Run Tests menu is used to start, stop, and monitor a test run. This menu can be customized to include  additional actions, so you may see additional options. A custom menu is developed as part of a test suite, so it is visible only when the test suite is in use.</p>
		<p>The following table describes the default items in the Run Tests menu.</p>
		<table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="5" class="gray" summary="The contents and description of the Run Tests menu." title="Run Tests Menu">

<tr valign="top">
<th scope="col" class="left" width="15%">

</tr>

<tr valign="top">
<td><IMG SRC="../../images/runTests_button.gif"  ALT="Start Test Run button displayed on the tool bar" longdesc="window.html">&nbsp; Start</td>
<td>
The  harness enables the Start menu item when it is not running tests. Choose
  the Start menu item to start a test run.
