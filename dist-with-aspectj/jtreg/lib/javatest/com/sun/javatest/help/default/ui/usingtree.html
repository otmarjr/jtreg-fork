<h1>Test Tree</h1>

<p>
The test tree is a multifunction panel that performs the following functions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Displays the
    current status and state of tests in the test suite</li>
  <li>Enables users to choose
    any combination of tests and folders in the test suite for a test run</li>
  <li>Enables users to 
    refresh or to clear  specific test results</li>
</ul>
<p>The test tree supports keyboard navigation.
  See <a href="keyboardAccess.html">Keyboard
    access</a> for a description of how the keyboard can be used to navigate
  the test tree pane.</p>
<!--insert:TestTree-->

<h2>Displaying Test Status and State</h2>
<p>The test tree uses folder icons, test icons, and two independent types of
  filtering (run filtering and view filtering) to simultaneously display the
  progress of a test run and the current test results in the work directory.</p>
<p>
The test tree indicates the progress of a test run by displaying an arrow to
  the left of each folder and test icon as it is loaded and run. See <a href="../run/testTree.html">Monitoring With a Test Tree</a> for detailed information about using the test tree to monitor
  a test run.</p>

<p>
Based on the Test Manager view filter, the test tree updates the folder and test
result icons to indicate the current test results in the work directory.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Example:</p>
  <p>When you choose the Current Configuration view filter, the test tree only
    displays the results for the tests specified in your current configuration.
    If you choose the All Tests view filter, the test tree immediately redisplays
    all test results from the work directory regardless of the settings in your
    current configuration. To display
    filtered summary information about the test results in the work directory,
    click the test suite icon in the test tree.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
See <a href="../browse/viewFilters.html">View Filters</a> for a detailed
description of how to specify which test results from the work directory are
displayed in the test tree.</p>

<p>
When you click a folder icon in the test tree,
the  harness displays its folder view in the Test Manager information
area. The Test Manager uses the view filter to filter results displayed in the
folder view. See <a href="../browse/folderInfo.html">Displaying Folder Information</a> for additional information.</p>

<p>
When you click a test icon in the test tree, the
 harness displays its test view in the Test Manager information area.
Unlike the folder view, the Test Manager does not filter results in the test
view. See <a href="../browse/testInfo.html">Test View</a> for additional information.</p>
<h2>Run, Refresh, or Clear Results</h2>
<p>
You can select any combination of tests and test folders
  and  right click in the test tree to open a pop-up menu for performing
  the following actions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Execute highlighted folders and tests by performing a quick pick execution.</li>
<li>Refresh the list of folders and tests without restarting the  harness
  by performing an on-demand refresh scan for new folders, new tests and updated
  test descriptions.</li>
<li>Clear Results by performing an on-demand clearing of the contents of the
  highlighted folder, test, or entire work directory.</li>
</ul>


<!--insert:refresh-clear-->


<p>If a single test or folder is highlighted in the test tree, the Test Manager
  displays the appropriate Test View or Folder View. However, when multiple tests
  and folders are highlighted in the test tree, the  harness displays
  a Multiple Tree Nodes Selected pane that lists the highlighted tests and folders.
  Highlight multiple tests and folders  in the test tree by using
  standard keystrokes (such as Shift and Control) and clicking the test and
  folder icons in the test tree.</p>
<p> The selection list in the Multiple Tree Nodes Selected pane displays
    the full path of each node highlighted in the test tree. Click  a test
  or folder in the test tree  a second time to remove the highlighting
  and  to remove it from the selection list. The GUI displays the updated Multiple
  Tree Nodes Selected pane.</p>
<p>Folders and tests do not have to be highlighted in the test tree for you to
  use the pop-up menu. See <a href="popupmenu.html">Test Tree Pop-up Menu</a> for
detailed information about using the pop-up menu.</p>
