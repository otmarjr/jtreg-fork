<h1>Quick Start</h1>

<p>
The harness includes a Quick Start wizard that enables
  users to quickly create combinations of test suite, work directory, and configuration
  files and open them in properly configured Test Manager windows.
  The harness opens the wizard when one of the following conditions
  occur:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The harness cannot restore an existing desktop.</li>
  <li>A user includes a command-line option in the command to start the GUI.</li>
  <li>A user opens a new Test Manager window.</li>
</ul>
<p>In each case, the wizard enables  the user to specify one of the
  following tasks: </p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="#startRun">Start a New Test Run.</a></li>
  <li><a href="#resumeRun">Resume Work on a Test Run.</a></li>
  <li><a href="#browse">Browse the Contents of a Test Suite.</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Because each of these tasks has a different set of test suite, work directory,
  and configuration file requirements, the wizard presents the user
  with a set of questions that collect the information required for that specified
  task. When the wizard has collected the required information, it
  opens a new Test Manager window that is properly set up to perform the specified
  task.</p>

<a name="startRun"></a>
<h2>Starting a New Test Run</h2>
<p>The harness requires that you have a test suite, a work directory,
  and a valid configuration loaded in the Test Manager before running tests.
  To properly set up the Test Manager, when you choose Start a New Test Run,
  the wizard displays a series of questions that prompt you to choose the type
  of configuration used (load a template or create a new configuration), specify
  a test suite, and choose a work directory.  See the following topics for additional
  information about templates, test suites and work directories:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="../templates/usingTemplate.html">Working With Templates</a></li>
  <li><a href="openTestSuite.html">Opening a Test Suite</a></li>
  <li><a href="openDirectory.html">Opening a Work Directory</a></li>
  <li><a href="createDirectory.html">Creating a Work Directory</a></li>
</ul>

<p>In the last panel, the wizard displays two options: automatically open the Configuration Editor and automatically begin the test run.</p>


<p>If you choose
  not to automatically open the Configuration Editor when the wizard closes, 
  the harness displays the Test Manager. In either case, before the harness
  begins to run tests, it verifies that the configuration is complete. If configuration values are missing or invalid, the harness displays a dialog box describing the problem before opening the Configuration Editor.
</p>
<p>
See the following topics
  for additional information about working with configurations:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="../confEdit/createConfiguration.html">Creating a Configuration</a></li>
  <li><a href="../confEdit/editConfiguration.html">Editing a  Configuration</a></li>
</ul>

<a name="resumeRun"></a>
<h2>Resuming Work on a Test Run</h2>
<p>If you choose to resume work on a test run, the wizard only prompts you for
  the work directory. Because
  each work directory is mapped to a test suite and a configuration file, you
  do not provide any additional information to the harness. See <a href="openDirectory.html">Opening
  a Work Directory</a> for additional information about using an existing work
  directory.</p>
<p>In the last panel, the wizard displays two options: automatically open the Configuration Editor and automatically begin the test run.</p>


<p>If you choose
  not to automatically open the Configuration Editor when the wizard closes, 
  the harness displays the Test Manager. In either case, before the harness
  begins to run tests, it verifies that the configuration is complete. If configuration values are missing or invalid, the harness displays a dialog box describing the problem before opening the Configuration Editor.
</p>



<a name="browse"></a>
<h2>Browsing the Contents of a Test Suite</h2>
<p>If you want to view the tests in a test suite without running them, the wizard only requires that you specify the test suite. While the wizard provides you with the option of creating a
  configuration file for the test suite, this is not required. If you choose
  not to create a
  configuration file for the test suite,  
  the harness closes the wizard and opens a Test Manager window containing the test suite.</p>
<p>See <a href="openTestSuite.html">Opening
  a Test Suite</a> for a additional information about loading
  a test suite.</p>
<p class="note">
  <!--CopyOff--><IMG SRC="../../images/hg_note.gif" ALT="The following text is a note" longdesc="quickStart.html"> <br>
  <!--CopyOn-->
Until you provide both a work directory and a valid configuration file, you cannot run tests.</p>
