<p>By choosing Select tests that match, you can run tests with restrictions based
  on their result from a prior test run. The following table describes the available
  Prior Status filter selections.</p>

<p>
Prior status is evaluated on a test-by-test basis using information stored in
  the result files (<a name="jtr"><code>.jtr</code></a>) that are written in
  the work directory. Unless overridden by a test suite, a result file is written
  in the work directory for every test that is executed. When users change work
  directories between test runs, the result files in the previous work directory
  are no longer used and, if the new work directory is empty, the harness
  behaves as though each test in the test suite was not run.</p>
