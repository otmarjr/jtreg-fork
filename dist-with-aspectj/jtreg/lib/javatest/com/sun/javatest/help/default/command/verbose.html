<H1>Monitoring Test Progress With <CODE>verbose</CODE></H1>
<P>Including the <CODE>verbose</CODE> command and optional monitoring options in a run command allows the user to monitor test progress from the command line. This command uses <CODE>stdout</CODE> to display the specified levels of monitoring test run progress.  This monitoring function is not available in the GUI.If you use the <CODE>verbose</CODE> command and options, set it as the first flag in the command line. Because it takes effect at the point in the command line where it appears, if the <CODE>verbose</CODE> command does not preceed the other commands, commands executed before it appears on the command line are not be shown.</P>
<H2>Monitoring Options</H2>
<P>The monitoring options  are specified in the command
  line as a comma-separated list following the <CODE>-verbose</CODE> option.
  A colon (:)  is used to separate the <CODE>-verbose</CODE> command from the options.
  Ordering and capitalization within the list are ignored. Whitespace within
  the list is prohibited.</P>
<P>If you do not specify a level, the <CODE>progress</CODE> option is automatically used.</P>

<P>See <a href="#examples">Examples of Monitoring Output</A> for detailed examples of the command line.</P>
<P>The following table  describes monitoring options  specified

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top"><code>commands</code></td>
    <td>Traces the individual harness commands as they are executed. If this option is used, it should be set first in the command line.
      Traced harness commands include options given on the command line, commands given in command
    strings, and commands given in command files. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top"><CODE>no-date</CODE> </td>
    <td>Does not prefix entries with the data and time stamp. Normally, each logical
    line of output prints the month, day, hour, minute and second.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top"><CODE>non-pass</CODE></td>
    <td>Prints non-passing (error, fail) test names and their status string. The
      status string includes the status (error, fail) and the reason for the
    failure or error. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top"><CODE>max</CODE> </td>
    <td>Outputs the maximum possible amount of output. This includes all the options
      which are individually available. If this option is present, only the <CODE>no-date</CODE> and <CODE>quiet</CODE> flags have any additional effect.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top"><CODE>quiet</CODE> </td>
    <td>Suppresses any output from the verbose system. It might be useful to temporarily
      deactivate monitoring while debugging, without removing other levels coded
      into a script. <CODE>-verbose:stop,progress,quiet</CODE> results in no
      output, as does <CODE>-verbose:quiet,stop,progress</CODE>. This option
      takes precedence over all other options. It does not suppress the pass,
      fail, and error statistics printed at the end of the test run. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top"><CODE>start</CODE> </td>
    <td>Prints the test name when it goes into the harness' engine for execution.
      Note: On some test suites, this might only indicate that the test has been
    handed to the plug-in framework, not that it is actually executing. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top"><CODE>stop</CODE>
    </td>
    <td>Prints the test name and status string (see <CODE>non-pass</CODE>) when
    a test result is received by the harness. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top"><CODE>progress</CODE> </td>
    <td>Prints a progress summary, which indicates pass, fail, error, and not-run
      numbers. If any of the <CODE>max, non-pass, stop,</CODE> or <CODE>stop</CODE> options
      were specified, each summary migh be printed on its own line. If not, the
      summary will be updated on the current line. The progress information is
    printed/updated each time a test result is reported to the harness. </td>
