<H1>Configuring a Test Run</H1>
<p>
Before the harness can execute the tests in a test suite, it requires information
  about how your computing environment is configured. You provide the harness
  with this information by loading a template (<code>.jtm</code>),
  loading an existing configuration file (<code>.jti</code>), creating a new
  configuration, or changing the values in a configuration.</p>

<p class="note">

<br><!--CopyOn-->
You can also specify configuration values from the command line when starting the harness GUI.
</p>

<p>
The quantity and scope of information required to run tests depends on the test
  suite. Some test suites run in diverse environments (different platforms and
  networks), while others run in very specific, well-defined environments. The
  test suite may provide a configuration interview or a template  for you to
  use in creating a configuration for your test run. If your test suite does
  not provide any of these, consult the test suite documentation for directions
  about how you can supply the required configuration information.</p>
