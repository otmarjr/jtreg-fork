<h1>Creating and Displaying Reports</h1>

<p>
The harness does not automatically create reports at the end of a
  test run. You must use the harness to manually create a new report after the test run.
  You can create and view reports containing the following test run information:</p>
<ul>
<li>
Tests grouped by test status
</li>
<li>
Configuration interview questions and answers
</li>
<li>
Test environment used for the test run
</li>
</ul>

<p>
See <a href="newReports.html">Creating Reports</a> for a description of how to  create test reports.
</p>
<p>
To view reports in the harness Report Browser, choose Report
<b>&gt;</b> Open Report from the menu bar. See <a href="reportBrowser.html">Displaying Reports</a> for a description of how to view reports.
</p>
<p>
Because harness reports contain relative and fixed links to other files,
  you must update these links when moving reports to other directories. The harness provides a command-line utility for you to use when moving reports to other directories. 
  See <a href="../command/moveReports.html">Moving Test Reports</a> in the <em>Command-Line Interface User's Guide</em> for a description of how to use the <code>EditLinks</code> utility to move reports.</p>
