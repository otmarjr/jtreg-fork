<h1>Starting a Test Run</h1>
<p>
When the harness is not running tests, it enables both the <IMG SRC="../../images/runTests_button.gif"  ALT="Start Test Run button displayed on the tool bar" longdesc="starting.html"> &nbsp; button on the tool bar and the Run Tests <code> &gt; </code> Start menu item.
</p>

<p class="note">
<!--CopyOff--><IMG SRC="../../images/hg_note.gif" ALT="The following text is a note" longdesc="starting.html">
<br><!--CopyOn-->
Only one test run at a time can be active in each Test Manager. 
</p>

<p>
To start a test run using the current configuration, either click the <IMG SRC="../../images/runTests_button.gif"  ALT="Start Test Run button displayed on the tool bar" longdesc="starting.html"> &nbsp; button or choose Run Tests <tt>&gt;</tt> Start. You can also use the test tree pop-up menu to run a specific test or group of tests in a folder. See <a href="../ui/popupmenu.html">Test Tree Pop-Up Menu</a>.</p>

<p>
Before the harness attempts to run the test suite, it verifies that the required configuration information is complete. You can view the configuration state in the Test Manager Properties browser. See <a href="../execProps/dialog.html">Viewing Test Manager Properties</a> for a description of the browser.
</p>

<p> If the configuration information is not provided or is incomplete, the
  harness opens a dialog box advising you that the configuration must be completed
  before it can begin running tests. You can choose to open the configuration
  editor window or cancel the test run. If you choose to open the configuration,
  the harness opens the configuration at the incomplete section.</p>


<p>
To change the test suite or work directory before running tests, refer to the
  following topics:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<a href="../start/openTestSuite.html">Opening a Test Suite</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="../start/openDirectory.html">Opening a Work Directory</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="../start/createDirectory.html">Creating a Work Directory</a>
</li>
</ul>


<p>
If a JT Harness agent is used to run the tests for your product, you must
  start the agent before you begin the test run. See <em>JT Harness Agent
  User's Guide</em> for detailed information about the JT Harness agent.
</p>
<p>
If the harness starts the test run and issues a request before the active agent starts running, the harness waits for an available agent until the timeout period ends. If the timeout period ends before an agent is available, the harness reports an error for the test.
