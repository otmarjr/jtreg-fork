<h1 class="glossTerm">Test Environment</h1>

<p class="glossText">&nbsp;&nbsp;
A collection of <a href="configurationValues.html">configuration values</a> derived from <a href="environmentVariables.html">environment entries</a> in the configuration file that provide information used by test suite specific plugin code about how to execute and run each test on a particular platform.
</p>

<p class="glossText">&nbsp;&nbsp;When a test in a legacy <a href="testSuite.html">test suite</a> is run, the harness gives the script a test environment containing environment entries from configuration data collected by the configuration editor. See <a href="configuration.html">configuration</a>. </p>

<p class="glossText">&nbsp;&nbsp;For legacy test suites, the environment entries were read from an environment file. Use of environment files is deprecated, but the harness continues to provide support for test suites that use environment files. See <a href="environmentFiles.html">environment file</a>. </p>
		<p class="glossText">&nbsp;&nbsp;Current test suites do not use or support environment files.</p>
