<H1>JT Harness User's Guide </H1>
<p>
This User's Guide describes how to use the harness to run
tests and evaluate test results.  This page describes
the different actions used to display information from the online User's Guide in a viewer provided by the harness.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Graphical User Interface User's Guide</em> - contains
information about using the GUI.</li>
<li> 
<em>Command-Line Interface User's Guide</em> - contains command-line
and utility information.</li>
<li>  
<em>JT Harness Agent User's Guide</em> - (available only if supplied by the
test suite) contains information about the optional agent.</li>
</ul>

<!--CopyOff-->
<p>
Throughout the online version, the <IMG SRC="../images/hg_note.gif" ALT="The following text is a note" longdesc="jthelp.html"> icon
is used to identify additional information that may be required to fully understand
a topic. </p>

<H2>Accessing the Online Documentation</H2>

<p>
You can display an online version of the documentation with
  or without starting the GUI. To display the User's Guides without starting the GUI, type
the following command from the directory where the <code>javatest.jar</code> file resides:</p>
<p><code>java -jar javatest.jar -userGuide</code></p>
<p>Because the harness provides the documentation viewer, no additional software is required.</p>
<p>The following
  table describes user actions in the GUI that display the User's Guides and other
  online information:</p>
