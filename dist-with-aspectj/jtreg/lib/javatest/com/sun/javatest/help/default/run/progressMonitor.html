<h1>Progress Monitor</h1>

<p>
The Progress Monitor is a dialog box that only displays information about the
  current configuration when the harness is running tests. The information displayed
  is equivalent to the Last Test Run view filter set in the Test Manager.
  Changing view filters in the Test Manager does not change the information
  displayed by the Progress Monitor.</p>

<p>
Choose Run Tests &gt; Monitor Progress from the Test Manager menu bar
or click the <IMG SRC="../../images/magnify1.gif" ALT="Progress Monitor button" longdesc="progressMonitor.html" > icon
at the bottom of the Test Manager to open
the Progress Monitor.</p>

<center>
<img src="../../images/testMonitor.gif" border="0" alt="The Progress Monitor dialog box" longdesc="progressMonitor.html">
</center>
<p>
The following areas in the Progress Monitor display information about the test
  run:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="#progressMonitor.progress">Progress</a>
  </li>
  <li><a href="#progressMonitor.test">Tests in Progress</a>
  </li>
  <li><a href="#progressMonitor.memory">Memory</a>

  <li><a href="#progressMonitor.time">Time</a>

</ul>
<a name="progressMonitor.progress"><!-- index:Progress Monitor: Progress area --></a>
<h2>Progress</h2>
<p>
The following table describes the information displayed in the Progress area.
<table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="5" class="gray" summary="The contents and description of the Progress area." title="Progress Area Contents">

A colored progress bar representing the results of the tests in the test suite.

<p>
As the  harness runs tests, the test results are displayed as
  colored segments in the progress bar. The colors used in the progress bar represent
  the current status of the test results.</p>
<p>
The colors below are the  harness default settings. The  harness
  supports using colors other than the default settings. See 
   <a href="../command/settingColors.html">Specifying
  Status Colors</a> in the <em>JT Harness User's
  Guide: Command-Line Interface</em>.</p>
<p>
The progress bar is the same as that displayed in the test progress display at the bottom of the Test Manager.
</p>

The following table describes the colors used in the progress bar. The colors
  are displayed from left to right in the  order in which they are presented
  in the table.</p>

<p>
You can display the progress bar in the Test Manager by clicking the <IMG SRC="../../images/drop-down.gif" ALT="Test Progress display drop-down list" longdesc="progressMonitor.html">  button and choosing Run Progress Meter from the selectable list. See <a href="progressMeter.html">Using the Progress Meter</a> for detailed description.
</p>

<a name="progressMonitor.test"><!-- index:Progress Monitor: Tests in Progress --></a>
<h2>Tests in Progress</h2>

<p>
The Tests in Progress text box displays either the names of the tests that the
  harness is currently running or the set of tests distributed
  for execution. It is empty when the harness is not running tests.
  Concurrency settings and agents in use determine the number of items displayed
  in the text box. See your test suite documentation for additional information.</p>

<p>
Clicking on this list  displays the appropriate test view in the Test Manager. 
</p>

<a name="progressMonitor.memory"><!-- index:Progress Monitor: Memory --></a>
<h2>Memory</h2>

<p>
The Memory area contains two text fields and a bar graph. The following table
  describes the contents of the Memory area in the Progress Monitor.
</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="5" class="gray" summary="The contents and description of the Progress Monitor Memory area." title="Memory Area Contents">

<a name="progressMonitor.time"><!-- index:Progress Monitor: Time --></a>
<h2>Time</h2>

<p>
The Time area contains two fields that are continuously updated throughout a
  test run. The following table
  describes the contents of the Time area in the Progress Monitor.</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="5" class="gray" summary="The contents and description of the Time area." title="Time Area Contents">

<tr valign="top" >
<td scope="row">

<td>
The estimated time required to run the remaining tests. 
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
Tests that timeout or have execution times significantly longer than the other
  tests being run can cause the harness to display inaccurate times.</p>
