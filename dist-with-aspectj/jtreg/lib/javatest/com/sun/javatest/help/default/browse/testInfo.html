The test view does not use view filtering to display information. If you are
using a view filter other than All Tests, the status
color displayed in this view might not match the test
icon or
the folder view tab.</p>

  field at the bottom of the pane contains a description of the test result and
  is visible in all of the test view panes.</p>
