<H1 class="proc">Specifying  Test Environment Files</H1>
<p>Currently test suites obtain configuration values from environment entries in a configuration file (<tt>.jti</tt>). </p>
<p>For legacy test suites the environment values are read from a test environment file (<tt>.jte</tt>). The Configuration Editor uses the values from these <code>.jte</code> files to build the configuration (<code>.jti)</code> file. Current test suites do not use or support the test environment file.</p>

<p><!--CopyOff--><img src="../../images/hg_proc.gif" alt="This is the start of a procedure" longdesc="environment.html"><!--CopyOn-->To
  include the values from the environment files in the configuration, perform
  the following steps:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Click the <img src="../../images/stdValues_button.gif" alt="QuickSet Mode button" width="10" height="11" longdesc="toolBar.html">&nbsp; Quick Set Mode button on the Test Manager tool bar or choose Configure &gt; Edit Quick Set &gt; Test Environment in the menu bar. The Configuration Editor displays the Test Environment tab only if your test suite used <code>.jte</code> files to run tests.</li>
  </ol>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The Configuration Editor opens in Quick Set Mode. The following illustration clips the More Info panel.</p>
