Specifying a Configuration File With <CODE>config</CODE>
</H1>
<P>To specify the configuration file the harness uses to run tests,
  use the <CODE>config</CODE> command.</P>
<P class="indent2"><a href="aboutExamples.html"><em>&gt; jtharness</EM></A> ... <CODE>-config</CODE> <EM>path/filename</EM> ... [<EM>task-command</EM>] ...</P>
<P>See <a href="aboutExamples.html">About the Command-Line Examples</A> for a description of <em>&gt; jtharness</EM> in the example.</P>
<P>The configuration file might contain default values for the test suite (which contains the tests to be run) and the work directory (where the results are placed).</P>
<P>Test suite and work directory values in the configuration file can be overridden with the <CODE>testsuite</CODE> and <CODE>workdirectory</CODE> commands.
  If the configuration file is a template and does not contain default values
  for the test suite and work directory, those values must be specified explicitly
with the testsuite and workdirectory commands.</P>
<P>See <a href="commandLine.html">Command-Line Overview</A> for a description of the command line structure.</P>
<H2>Detailed Example of <code>config</code> Command </H2>
<P>In the following example, <EM>myconfig</em><code>.jti</code> represents a configuration file name that might exist on your system.</P>
