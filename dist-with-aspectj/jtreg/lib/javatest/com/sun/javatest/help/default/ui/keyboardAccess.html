<h1>Keyboard access</h1>
<p>
The harness uses standard Java programming language key bindings for
  keyboard traversal and access of the GUI. See the <em>Java Look and Feel Design
  Guidelines</em> at <code>http://java.sun.com/products/jlf/</code> for
  a detailed description of the standard key bindings for keyboard traversal
  and access of the GUI.</p>
<p>
The window or component must have keyboard focus before
you can use keyboard navigation, activation, or shortcuts. Keyboard navigation, activation,
and shortcut operations are described in the following
topics.
</p>

<a name="focus"></a><h2>Keyboard Focus</h2>

<p>
When a component has focus, it is generally displayed with a colored border or
  changes color. However, some components in the GUI cannot be displayed with
  a focus indicator. In this case, you must continue to use the keyboard to traverse
  the GUI until focus is displayed.
</p>

<a name="shortcuts"></a><h2>Keyboard Shortcuts</h2>

<p>
Keyboard shortcuts perform both navigation and activation in the same action.
  The following table lists the keys that are used to access menus and online
  help.</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" class="gray" summary="Keyboard shortcuts." title="Keyboard Shortcuts for Navigation and Activation">
<tr valign="top">
<th  width="20%" valign="top" align="left" scope="col">

</TH>
<th align="left" scope="col">

</th>
</tr>

<tr valign="top">
<td>
F1
</td>
<td>
Activates the online help.</td>
</tr>

<tr valign="top">
<td>
F10
</td>
<td>
Activates the File menu.
</td>
</tr>

<tr valign="top">
<td>
Shift F10
</td>
<td>
Activates the pop-up menu if focus is on a folder or test in the test tree.
</td>
</tr>

</table>


<a name="mnemonics"></a><h3>Hot Key Shortcuts</h3>
<p>
The harness provides shortcuts throughout the application for accessing menu titles, menu items, text fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, and command buttons.
</p>

<p>
Shortcut keys are identified in the following ways:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Text at the end of tool tips - </b>For example, Start Running
Tests Alt-S
</li>
 
<li>
<b>Underlined letters in menus and text buttons </b><b>-</b> For
example, <b><u>F</u>ile</b>
</li>

<li>
<b>Underlined letters in labeled fields -</b> For example, <u>R</u>esponse:
</li>
</ul>


<a name="navigation"></a><h2>Keyboard Navigation</h2>
<p>
Keyboard navigation enables you to move keyboard focus from one GUI component
  to another by using the keyboard without activating the component. The following
  table lists the keys used for keyboard navigation.</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" class="gray.wide" summary="Keyboard navigation keys." title="Keyboard Navigation Keys">
<tr>
<th width="15%" valign="top" align="left" scope="col">
Navigation Key
</TH>
<th align="left" scope="col">
GUI Action
</th>
</tr>

<tr valign="top">
<td>
Tab</td>
<td>
Navigates to the next focusable component in the GUI. The tab traversal order is generally left to right and top to bottom.
</td>
</tr>

<tr valign="top">
<td>
Shift-Tab</td>
<td>
Navigates back to the next focusable component.
</td>
</tr>

<tr valign="top">
<td>
Control-Tab</td>
<td>
Navigates to the next focusable component even if the current component accepts the Tab key as input (such as a text area).
</td>
</tr>

<tr valign="top">
<td>
Control-Shift Tab</td>
<td>
Navigates back to the next focusable component even if the current component accepts the Tab key as input (such as a text area).
</td>
</tr>

<tr valign="top">
<td>
Left arrow</td>
<td>
Moves keyboard focus left one character or component. <br>If focus is in the test tree, focus moves up the tree and closes the node. <br>If focus is on the splitter bar (F8 moves focus to the splitter bar), it moves the splitter bar left.
</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>
Right arrow</td>
<td>
Moves keyboard focus right one character or component. <br>If focus is in the test tree, focus moves sequentially down the tree, opening the node and traversing all tests in a folder. <br>If focus is on the splitter bar (F8 moves focus to the splitter bar), it moves the splitter bar right. 
</td>
</tr>

<tr valign="top">
<td>
Up arrow</td>
<td>
Moves keyboard focus up one line or component. <br>If focus is in the test tree, focus moves sequentially up the tree but does not open any closed folders. <br>If focus is on the splitter bar (F8 moves focus to the splitter bar), it moves the splitter bar left.
</td>
</tr>

<tr valign="top">
<td>
Down arrow</td>
<td>
Moves keyboard focus down one line or component. <br>If focus is in the test tree,  focus moves sequentially down the tree but does not open any closed folders. <br>If focus is on the splitter bar (F8 moves focus to the splitter bar), it moves the splitter bar right.
</td>
</tr>

<tr valign="top">
<td>
Page Up</td>
<td>
Navigates up one pane of information within a scroll pane.
</td>
</tr>

<tr valign="top">
<td>
Page Down</td>
<td>
Navigates down one pane of information within a scroll pane.
</td>
</tr>

<tr valign="top">

Moves to the end of the data. In a table, moves to the last cell in a row. If focus is in the test tree, moves to the bottom of the tree.
</td>
</tr>

<h3>Navigation in Hyperlinked Text</h3>

<p>
Navigating hyperlinks in text areas such as the More
Info pane and report viewer requires
that you establish focus in the pane itself. After you have established focus
inside the pane, use the keyboard navigation keys listed in Keyboard
Navigation to navigate in the pane. Because some components in the
GUI cannot display focus, you have to use the keyboard to traverse the GUI until
you can determine that focus is established inside the pane.</p>
<p>
After focus is established in the pane, use Control-T and Shift-Control-T to
  navigate to the next and previous link in the document. Use Control and Space bar
  to select (follow) the hyperlink. See <a href="#activation">Keyboard Activation</a> for
  a list of keys used for keyboard activation.</p> 


<h3>Navigation in Folder Pane Status Tabs</h3>

<p>
Navigating in the folder pane test status tabs
requires that you establish focus in the pane itself.</p>
<p>
After focus is established in the pane, use the Arrow Up and Arrow Down keys listed
  in Keyboard Navigation to navigate in the pane. When
  only a single entry is present in the folder pane, you must use the Home or
  End key to select the item.</p>
<p>
Because some components in the GUI cannot be displayed with focus indicators,
  you may have to use the keyboard to traverse the GUI until you can determine
  that focus is established inside the folder pane.</p>
<p>
Use the Return or Enter key to navigate to the selected item. See <a href="#activation">Keyboard
Activation</a> for a list of keys used for keyboard activation.</p>


<h3>Navigation in the Test Tree</h3>

<p>
Navigating in a test tree requires that you establish focus in the test tree
  itself.</p>
<p>
After focus is established in the pane, use Arrow Up, Arrow Down, Arrow Left,
  and Arrow Right keys listed in Keyboard Navigation to
  navigate in the pane.</p>


<a name="activation"></a><h2>Keyboard Activation</h2>
<p>
After navigating to a component, you can then use the keyboard to activate the
  component. The following table lists the key that are used to activate GUI
  components.</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" class="gray" summary="Keyboard activation." title="Keyboard Activation">
<tr valign="top">
<th valign="top" align="left" scope="col" width="15%">

<th align="left" scope="col">

</tr>

<tr valign="top">
<td>
Enter or Return
</td>
<td>
Activates the default command button.
</td>
</tr>

<tr valign="top">
<td>
Escape
</td>
<td>
Dismisses a menu or dialog box without changes.
</td>
</tr>

<tr valign="top">
<td>
Space Bar
</td>
<td>
Activates the tool bar button that has keyboard focus.
</td>
</tr>


<tr valign="top">
<td>
Shift-Space Bar
</td>
<td>
Extends the selection of items in a list.
</td>
</tr>

<tr valign="top">
<td>
Control-Space Bar
</td>
<td>
If the item with focus is in a list, it toggles the selection state of the item without affecting any other list selections. <br>If the item is a link, it follows the link.
</td>
</tr>
