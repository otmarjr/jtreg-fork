<h1 class="glossTerm">Exclude List</h1>

<p class="glossText">&nbsp;&nbsp;
Exclude list files (*<code>.jtx</code>), supply a list of invalid tests to be filtered out of a test run by the test harness. The exclude list provides a level playing field for all implementors by ensuring that when a test is determined to be invalid, then no implementation is required to pass it. Exclude lists are maintained by the technology specification Maintenance Lead and are made available to all technology licensees. 
</p>
<p class="glossText">&nbsp;&nbsp;
In the GUI, use the configuration editor to add or remove exclude lists from a test run. In the command line, you can specify an exclude list in the command.
</p>
<p class="glossText">&nbsp;&nbsp;
To view the contents of an exclude list, choose Configure <code><b>-&gt;</b></code> Show
Exclude List from the Test Manager menu bar. Exclude lists can only be edited
or modified by the test suite Maintenance Lead.
