<h1 class="glossTerm">Test Case</h1>

<p class="glossText">&nbsp;&nbsp;
A subsection inside of a test.  The terminology for a 'test case' varies among test harnesses, but in this harness, a test is a larger entity than the test case.  A test contains zero or more test cases; a test with no test cases is simply a basic test entity in this harness.  The 'test' is the primary entity rendered in the main tree display, summaries, etc.  'Test cases' are currently only recognized in limited areas of the harness.
