<H1>Creating and Editing Templates</H1>
<p>
The harness provides users with the <strong><u>optional</u></strong> ability
  to create and edit templates that can be used to run tests on multiple test systems
or test platform.  </p>
<p class="Note">
  <!--CopyOff--><IMG SRC="../../images/hg_note.gif" ALT="The following text is a Note" longdesc="createTemplate.html"></br>
  <!--CopyOn-->
  Your test suite might not enable creating 
or editing templates. The menu items and features described here <b><u>will not appear in your user interface</u></b> if your test suite does not support templates. </p> 

<p>
For example, if your test suite enables creating and editing templates and your test group uses a central location to provide and manage the
  resources required to run tests (the test suite, report directories, configuration
  files, or the harness), you can create a
   template that contains all known configuration values required
  by the test group to run tests. Each user can load the  template
  from the central site, provide only those values unique to their test environment
  or test run, and run their tests using their completed configuration.</p>
<p>See <a href="createTemplate.html">Creating a Template</a> for a detailed
  description of the process used to create a template.</p>
<p>See <a href="editTemplate.html">Editing a Template</a> for a detailed description of the process used to
  change the contents of a template. </p>
<p>In addition to providing users with partially completed
   configurations, templates can further simplify the process of creating
  and maintaining configurations through the use of the following features:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Bookmarks</li>
  <li>Propagation</li>
</ul>

<p>An optional feature of templates is the ability to propagate (inherit) 
  template updates to
  all configurations based on that template. When the test suite developer enables template propagation,
  the harness checks for template updates when a user does any of the following: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Starts a test run.</li>
  <li>Opens a work directory.</li>
  <li>Loads a configuration.</li>
</ul>

<p>For a configuration to receive template updates, the test suite developer must enable propagation
in both the configuration and its template. </p>
