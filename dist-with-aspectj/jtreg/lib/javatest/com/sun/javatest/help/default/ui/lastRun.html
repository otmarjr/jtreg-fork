<h1>Last Test Run View Filter</h1>
<p>
When you select the Last Test Run view filter, the Test Manager displays
  the current totals in the Summary pane and status icons in the test tree for
  all folders and tests included in the last test run (even if you have exited
  the harness since the last test run) or the states from the test run in progress 
  if the harness is running tests. The information displayed in the Test Manager is associated with the work directory.</p>
<p>The following examples provide descriptions of the use of the Last Test Run
view filter:</p>
<ul>
  <li>    <b>
    Example 1 -</b> A test run had failed tests and you want to rerun
    only the failed tests. See <a href="../confEdit/status.html">Specifying Prior
    Status</a> for
    a detailed description of setting the prior status value. The Test Tree and
    the Summary pane continue to show all tests in the last test run regardless
  of their status.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    When you repeat the test run, the Test Manager clears the previous
      test results and only displays current status icons in the test tree and
      totals in the Summary pane for the tests and folders in the current test
      run.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
  <li>    <b>
    Example 2 -</b> A test run had failed tests and you want to use
    an Exclude List in the next run that excludes the failed tests from the test
    run. See <a href="../confEdit/excludeList.html">Using
    Exclude Lists</a> for a detailed description of specifying an exclude list.
    The Test Tree and the Summary pane do not change when the exclude list is
  added to the configuration.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    When you repeat the test run, the Test Manager clears the previous test results and only displays current status icons in the test tree and totals in the Summary pane for the tests and folders in the current test run.
  </p>
