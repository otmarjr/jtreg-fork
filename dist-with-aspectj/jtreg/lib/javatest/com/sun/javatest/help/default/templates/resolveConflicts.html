<H1>Resolving Configuration-Template Conflicts</H1>
<p>
When the harness detects a conflict between a configuration and its template, it displays a Template update conflict dialog box. 
</p>

</center>

<p>
By default, any change to a template is considered a Conflict and is listed in the Conflicts tab. Configuration 
users get to choose whether to accept the new template value, reject the value, or postpone deciding. 
</p>

<p>
A test suite can also declare a template question to be auto-updating. If a user changes an 
auto-updating value in the template, the harness replaces the corresponding property in 
the attached configuration. The updated value is listed on the Updates tab. 
</p>

<center>
<img src="../../images/JT4templateupdates.gif" alt="Template update dialog box" longdesc="resolveConflicts.html">
</center>
<p>
A user cannot refuse to accept an auto-updating value.</p>


<p>Choose a dialog button based on the following guidelines:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Change Now </b> - Click this button if you want the new template values
    to overwrite the corresponding configuration values. </li>
  <li><b>Don't Change </b> - Click this button if you want the new template values
    to be ignored. </li>
  <li><b>Remind Me Later</b> - Click this button if you want to defer the conflict
    resolution until the next time the  harness checks for  updates.</li>
</ul>
