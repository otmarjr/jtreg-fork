<H1>Command-Line Interface</H1>
<P>There are two harness editions: </P>
<ul>
  <li>The <em>test harness</em> is a full-featured test system that runs on a computer that has at least the resources of a laptop. </li>
  <li>The <em>lite harness</em> provides a subset of test harness features and can run on devices lacking some resources required to  run the test harness. </li>
</ul>
<p>The  test harness has two interfaces, a command-line interface (CLI), and a graphical user interface (GUI).</p>
<ul>
  <li>The command-line interface provides scriptable test harness functionality for configuring and executing tests and creating reports.  Information about using the command-line interface can be found in the following topics:</P>

  </UL></li>
  <li>The <a href="../ui/usingJT.html">GUI interface</a> is more suitable for interactive test harness users. </li>
</ul>
<p>The <a href="lite.html">lite harness</a> has a command-line interface that supports most test harness CLI commands except those that activate a graphics component (such as online help). </p>
