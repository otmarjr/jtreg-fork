<H1>Using Command Files</H1>
<P>A command file is a text file that contains one or more commands used by the
  harness from the command line or as a part of a product build process.
  You can place combinations of configuration settings and commands in the command
  file and use it to repeatedly perform the following actions:</P>
	<UL>
		<LI>Perform test runs</LI>
		<LI>Write test reports</LI>
	</UL>
<P>The advantage of using the command file format is that it is easy to use a complex, persistent, repeatable set of commands in a command line.</P>
<P>The commands used in a command file are a formatted set of commands, executed in the sequence that they appear in the command string. Use the commands in the command file as you would if you were writing a script.  See <a href="formatCommands.html">Formatting a Command</A> for a description of the formats you can use.</P>
<P>The following topics provide additional detailed information:</P>
