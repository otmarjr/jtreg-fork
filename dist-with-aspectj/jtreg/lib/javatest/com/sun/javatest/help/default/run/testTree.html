<h1>Monitoring With a Test Tree</h1>
<p>
The test tree uses folder icons, test icons, and two independent types of filtering
  (run filtering and view filtering) to simultaneously display the following
  conditions:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Progress of a test run
</li>
<li>
Current test results in the work directory
</li>
</ul>

<p>
When a test run begins, you can track its progress in the test tree by observing the folder and test icons. The test tree displays an arrow at the left of each folder and test icon as it is loaded and run.
</p>

<p>
After the harness completes running a test, it writes
  the test results to the work directory and updates the folder and test icons
  in the test tree. The test tree displays folder and test icons based on the
  view filter specified in the Test Manager window.</p>
<p>
The harness supports using status colors specified by the user instead
  of the default color settings. See 
   <a href="../command/settingColors.html">Specifying
Status Colors</a> in the <em>Command-Line Interface User's Guide</em>.</p>

<p>
Regardless of whether or not a test was run, the test tree displays filtered
  out <IMG SRC="../../images/grayFolder.gif" ALT="Filtered out folder"  longdesc="../browse/folderIcons.html"> folder
  and <IMG SRC="../../images/grayTest.gif" ALT="Test Filtered Out" longdesc="../browse/testIcons.html"> test
  icons for those tests and folders filtered out by the view filter. All other
  icons are updated to reflect their current result status from the work directory.</p>

<p>
Changing either the run or the view filter settings causes the  harness
  to immediately update the folder and test icons displayed in the test tree.</p>

<p>
  See <a href="../browse/viewFilters.html">View Filters</a> for a description
  of how to specify which test results from the work directory are displayed
  in the test tree.</p>
<p>
  See <a href="../ui/usingtree.html">Test Tree</a> for a detailed description
  of the icons, filters, and other features used in the test tree.</p>
<p>
The goal of a test run, when using the appropriate view filter, is for the root
  test suite folder to display the passed <IMG SRC="../../images/greenFolder.gif" ALT="Passed folder"  longdesc="../browse/folderIcons.html"> folder
  icon. The passed root test suite folder icon signifies that all tests in the
  test suite not filtered out of the test run (by specifying tests that are run,
  exclude lists, keywords, and prior status) with passed test results. See <a href="../confEdit/changeQuickSet.html">Changing QuickSet Values</a> for a description how to quickly set run filters that
  include or remove tests from a test run.</p>

<p>
Click the test suite icon in the test tree to display status information for
  the test suite in the Test Manager information area. The view filter used in
  the test tree is also used to display folder status information. See<!--CopyOff--><a href="../browse/folderInfo.html">Displaying Folder
  Information</a> for a detailed description of the folder information displayed in
  this area.</p>

<p>
By browsing the tabbed pane and the test tree, you can find the folders that
  contain tests without passed test results.</p>
