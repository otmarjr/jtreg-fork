<H1>Using the <CODE>batch</CODE> Command</H1>
<P>The <CODE>batch</CODE> command is a legacy command that is used to run tests from the command line or as part of a build process. If a task command is not included in the command line, the harness begins running tests automatically. The <a href="runTests.html"> <CODE>runTests</CODE></A> command supercedes the <CODE>batch</CODE> command.</P>
<P>The <CODE>batch</CODE> command is also used in the command line to close the harness when all commands are processed. If the <CODE>batch</CODE>command is used, the harness GUI will not start unless explicitly started by another commands in the command string.</P>
<P>If the GUI is started in batch mode (such as including the <CODE>monitorAgent</CODE> command), after all commands are executed the harness displays a dialog that enables the user to cancel the automatic shutdown and to use the harness GUI in normal mode.</P>
<P>In its legacy format, the <CODE>batch</CODE> command was required to precede
  the other commands. In the present format, the <CODE>batch</CODE> command can
  be specified in any location on the command line.</P>
