<H1>Working With Templates</H1>
<p>
The harness enables test suites to provide users with the capability
  of using templates to create configurations required to
  run tests on multiple test systems or test platforms.</p> 

<p>
For example, if your test suite enables using templates and your test group uses a central location to provide and manage the
  resources required to run tests (the test suite, report directories, configuration
  files, or the harness), a site administrator or user could provide templates
  containing the known configuration values required by the test group to
  run tests. A user could use that template to quickly create a configuration for their
  test run by including the values unique to their own test environment.</p>
<p>In addition to providing users with partially completed
  configurations, templates can further simplify the process of creating
  and maintaining configurations through the use of the following features:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Bookmarks</li>
  <li>Propagation</li>
</ul>
<!--When creating a template, use Bookmarks to display only the
  questions that require information from the user. Normally long interviews
  can often be reduced to a small set of required questions through the effective
  use of Bookmarks within a template.-->

<p>A feature of templates is the ability to propagate updates of a template to
  all configurations based on that template. When template propagation is enabled,
  the harness checks for template updates when a user does any of the following: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Starts a test run.</li>
  <li>Opens a work directory.</li>
  <li>Loads a configuration.</li>
</ul>
