<h1>Specifying Known Failures Lists With <code>kfl</code></h1>
<p>The ability to specify a known failures list is enabled in the configuration editor interview, as described in 
  <a href="../../default/report/newReports.html#specKFL">
Creating Reports</A> in the <em>Graphical User Interface User's Guide</em>. In the user interface, if the value for "Specify a Known Failures List?" is Yes and you have specified KFLs, they become the default values, and are used when you create reports using Reports &gt; Create New Report or using the <a href="writeReports.html"><code>-writeReports</code></a> HTML report type.</p>
<p> The <code>-kfl</code> option enables you to change the default list of KFL files from the command line.</p>

<p>You can call the KFL file(s) as follows. Multiple files are separated by spaces:</p>
<pre>java -jar ... -kfl foo.kfl bar.kfl path/foobar.kfl -runtests</pre>
<p class="note"><!--CopyOff--><IMG SRC="../../images/hg_note.gif" ALT="The following text is a note" longdesc="otherConfigValues.html"><br><!--CopyOn-->
  Note, because a space is a separator, file path arguments cannot contain spaces (for example, 
  <tt>C:\Program&nbsp;Files\myconfig\foobar</tt> will not work). 
<P>See <a href="commandLine.html">Command-Line Overview</A> for a detailed description of the command line structure. See <a href="formatCommands.html">Formatting a Command</A> for descriptions and examples of other command formats that you can use.</P>
