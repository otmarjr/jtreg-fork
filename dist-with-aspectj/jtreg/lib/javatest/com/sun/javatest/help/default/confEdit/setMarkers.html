<H1>Using Bookmarks in Configurations</H1>

<p>
In Question Mode, you can use Bookmarks to restrict the set of questions displayed
  in the Configuration Editor  (Bookmarks are not used in Quick Set Mode).
  Bookmarks are persistent and are saved in the <code>.jti</code> file, and reloaded
  when the configuration is used again. When bookmarks are disabled, they are
  preserved in program memory but cannot be manipulated.</p>
