<H1>Working with Multiple Configurations</H1>
<p>
In some testing situations it is useful to use separate configuration files to
  switch between different configurations for different test runs. For example,
  one configuration could select automated tests and another could select interactive
  tests.</p>

<!--insert:autotest-->


<p>
Prior to running tests, use the Configure menu to load the required configuration
  file. See <a href="loadConfiguration.html">Loading a Configuration</a> for
  detailed information. These configuration files can be loaded from a central
  resource provided by your test group. See your test group for the name and
  location of the configuration files.</p>

<p>
If your group does not provide an existing set of configuration files, you can create them by using the Configuration Editor to edit an existing configuration and then save each variation to a file name of your choosing. See <a href="editConfiguration.html">Editing a Configuration</a> for detailed information.
</p>

<!--insert:defaultsite-->

<p>
You can save these configuration files anywhere in your file system. Generally,
  however, the work directory should not be used to save configuration files.
   Clearing the work directory would  delete the configuration
  file.</p>

<p>
After these configuration files are created, they can be used by your test group
  to run tests.
