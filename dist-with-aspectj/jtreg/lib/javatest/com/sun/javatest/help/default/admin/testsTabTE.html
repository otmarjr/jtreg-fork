</ol>

<h2>Specifying Tests in the Test Tree </h2>
<p>
In the Template Editor test tree (not the Test Manager test tree) you can
  choose individual tests and folders of tests for the  harness to
  run. The  harness walks the test tree starting with the sub-branches
  or tests you specify and executes all tests not filtered out by the exclude
  list, keyword, or prior status.</p>

<p>
Restrictions are applied cumulatively. For example, you can specify the tests
in a test suite, then restrict the set of tests using an exclude list, and then
further restrict the set to only those tests that passed on a prior run.</p>

<p>If you choose a test folder, the  harness selects all tests in the test
  suite under that location for the test run.</p>

<p>
If you choose one or more tests, the  harness selects those individual
  tests for the test run.</p>

<p>
The Tests pane highlights all folder and test icons selected for the test run.
  You can make individual selections in the test tree by pressing the Control
  key when you click an icon or name in the test tree.</p>
<p>
To select a series or sequence of tests or folders, press the Shift key and then
  click the first and the last icon or name in the sequence.</p>
<p>
When you select some (but not all) of the tests in and under a folder, the Test
  pane partially highlights the folder icon.</p>

<h2 class="proc">Loading a Test List</h2>
<p><!--CopyOff--><img src="../../images/hg_proc.gif" alt="This is the start of a procedure" longdesc="testsTabTE.html"><!--CopyOn-->To
load a test list file in the template, perform the following steps:</p>


<ol>
  <li>Click the Load Test List button.</li>
  <li> Use the dialog box to locate and select a test list file.<br><br>See Test List File Format for a detailed description of a test list file.</li>
</ol>

<ol start="3">
  <li>When the file is loaded, the
    test tree is updated to indicate the tests that have been specified.</li>
</ol>
<h3> Test List File Format </h3>
<p>A test list is
  a <code>.txt</code> file containing a list of tests to run. See <a href="#createtestList">Creating
a Test List File</a> for a detailed description of the test list file. The format
requirements of the test list file are as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Line-oriented</li>
  <li>Relative test paths</li>
  <li> Blank lines and lines beginning with the pound symbol (#) are ignored</li>
  <li> On all other lines, the first item (up to the first whitespace) is taken
    as a test name and the remainder of the line is ignored</li>
</ul>
<p>The format of the load list file is the same as the format of the <code>summary.txt</code> generated
  as part of a report.</p>

<p><!--CopyOff--><img src="../../images/hg_proc.gif" alt="This is the start of a procedure" longdesc="testsTabTE.html"><!--CopyOn-->To
create a test list file, perform the following steps:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Select the lines
      from <code>summary.txt</code> that
      define the tests you want to run. 
<p class="note">
  <!--CopyOff--><IMG SRC="../../images/hg_note.gif" ALT="The following text is a Note" longdesc="createTemplate.html"><br><!--CopyOn--> You can use other sources for obtaining the path names
  of the tests that you want to include in the test list file. On a Solaris platform, you might use <code>awk</code>, <code>grep</code>,
    or similar utilities to identify lines that specify the tests with failed
    or  error results.</p>
