<h1>Configuration Editor Preferences</h1>
<p>To set the default display of the&nbsp;Configuration Editor More Info pane (on the right of the interview pane), select File &gt; Preferences, and choose Test Manager &gt; Configuration Editor. Check the More Info box if you want the Configuration Editor to show the More Info panel by default, and uncheck it if you always want it hidden by default.</p>
<p>You can override this preference from the Configuration Editor's View menu, however, when the harness is restarted the Configuration Editor uses this preference as the default.</p>
