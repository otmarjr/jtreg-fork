<H1>Using the <CODE>observer</CODE> Command</H1>
<P>The <CODE>observer</CODE> command is an advanced command that allows you to register
<CODE>com.sun.javatest.Harness.Observer</CODE> for monitoring a test run. For example, an observer can monitor the progress of each test run and implement custom behavior such as sending an email message if a test in a test run fails. See the API documentation for details or contact the harness team for help in using an observer.</P>
