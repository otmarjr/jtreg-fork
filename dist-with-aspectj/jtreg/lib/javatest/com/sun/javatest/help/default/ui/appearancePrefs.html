<a name="appearancePrefs.shutdown"><!-- index:shutdown options --></a>
<h2>Shutdown Options</h2>
<p>Check the <strong>Save Desktop State on Exit</strong> option to save your current desktop for use in a future test session. This default is on. </p>
<p>When you exit this option saves the current view filter information, recent work directories, and recent configuration information. If a desktop file exists, it will remain.</p>
<p>If you uncheck Save Desktop State on Exit and close the harness, the current view filter information is not saved. The next time you open a test session the harness opens the Quick Start Wizard (if the test suite author has enabled it) or an empty harness tool.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<a name="appearancePrefs.restore"><!-- index:Restore Tools State on Start --></a>
<p>Check <strong>Restore Tools State on Start</strong> to restore saved desktop settings. The default is on. If this option is not checked, the recent work directories and configuration information are restored but the tools are not.</p>
<p>If Restore Tools is set <b>on</B> and Save Desktop State on Exit is set <B>off</B>, the harness will always start with one tools set (although <B>-newdesktop</B> can be used to remove all data). </p>
