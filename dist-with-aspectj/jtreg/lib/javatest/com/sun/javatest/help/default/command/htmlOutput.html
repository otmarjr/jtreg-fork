<H1>HTML-Formatted Output</H1>
<P>The HTML-formatted output is provided as human-readable pages (these pages
  are subject to change in future releases of the harness), enabling
  users to remotely monitor batch mode test runs in a web browser and stop test
  runs that are not executing as expected. The following topics describe the
  HTML formatted output:</P>
	<UL>
		<LI><a href="#index">Server Index Page</A></LI>
		<LI><a href="#harness">Server Harness Page</A></LI>
		<LI><a href="#result">Server Test Result Index Page</A></LI>
		<LI><a href="#environment">Harness Environment Page</A></LI>
		<LI><a href="#interview">Harness Interview Page</A></LI>
		<LI><a href="#stop">Stop a Test Run</A></LI>

	<OL>
		<LI>Use the following command on the command line to activate the web server.
		  <P><A href="aboutExamples.html" class="nopdf"><EM>&gt; jtharness</EM></A> <CODE>-startHttp -runTests</CODE> <EM>[options]</EM></P>
<P>See <a href="aboutExamples.html">About the Command-Line Examples</A> for a description of the use of <EM>&gt; jtharness</EM>.</P></LI>

	</OL><H2><A name="index"></A>Displaying the HTTP Server Index Page</H2>
<P>The root of the web server provides an index page that only lists the handlers
  registered with the internal web server; not all available URLs on the server.
  You can also display the HTTP Server Index page by including
<CODE>/index.html</CODE>at the end of the URL in the browser URL field.</P>
<P>Example:<BR>
<CODE>http://129.145.162.75:1903/index.html</CODE></P>
<P>Each harness has its own handler, identified by a unique number as the second component of the URL.</P><H2><A name="harness"></A>Displaying HTTP Server Harness Page</H2>
<P>When the harness is running tests, the harness page displays the
  following information:</P>
	<UL>
		<LI>Name and location of the current test suite.</LI>
		<LI>Location of the work directory.</LI>
		<LI>Link to view the environment information provided to the harness and used in the current test run. Displays an HTML-formatted view of the current environment.</LI>
		<LI>Link to view the configuration interview used by the harness in the current test run. Displays a formatted view of the interview settings.</LI>
		<LI>Link to view the current test results. Displays the Test Result Index page.</LI>
	</UL>
<P>In addition to the list of registered handlers, the page also prints the UTC/GMT date on which that page was generated (subject to the system clock on the machine which harness is running) and provides the harness version number and build date.</P>
<P>You can display the HTTP Server Harness page by choosing its link on the index
  page or by including
<CODE>/harness</CODE> at the end of the URL in the browser URL field.</P>
<P>Example:<BR>
<CODE>http://129.145.162.75:1903/harness</CODE></P>
<H2><A name="result"></A>Displaying the HTTP Server Test Result Index Page</H2>
<P>The Test Result Index page displays the following information:</P>
	<UL>
		<LI>Work directory</LI>
		<LI>Total number of tests in the test suite</LI>
	</UL>
<P>The total number of tests is also a link to view the current test results. The test results are displayed in a two-column table, by test name and status message.</P>
<P>You can display the Test Result Index page by choosing its link on the harness page.</P>
<H2><A name="environment"></A>Displaying the Harness Environment Page</H2>
<P>The Harness Environment page displays the environment information provided to the harness and used in the current test run. The environment information is displayed in an HTML table and provides a view of the current settings.</P>
<P>You can display the Harness Environment page by choosing its link on the harness
  page or by including
<CODE>/harness/env</CODE> at the end of the URL in the browser URL field.</P>
<P>Example:<BR>
<CODE>http://129.145.162.75:1903/harness/env</CODE></P>
<H2><A name="interview"></A>Displaying the Harness Interview Page</H2>
<P>The Harness Interview page displays the configuration interview provided to the harness and used in the current test run.</P>
<P>You can display the Harness Interview page by choosing its link on the harness
  page or by including
<CODE>/harness/interview</CODE>at the end of the URL in the browser URL field.</P>
<P>Example:<BR>
<CODE>http://129.145.162.75:1903/harness/interview</CODE></P>
<H2><A name="stop"></A>Using HTTP Server to Stop a Test Run</H2>
<P>If you want to remotely terminate a test run, include
<CODE>/harness/stop</CODE>at the end of the URL in the browser URL field.</P>
<P>Example:<BR>
<CODE>http://129.145.162.75:1903/harness/stop</CODE></P>
<P>To stop the test run, you must click the STOP button on the page displayed in the browser.</P>
