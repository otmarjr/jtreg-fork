<h1>Test Tree Pop-Up Menu</h1>
<p>
The test tree provides a pop-up menu. Displaying the pop-up menu for a folder
  or test is a platform-specific operation (such as right clicking the folder
  or test icon in the test tree). You can also  press Shift-F10 
  to display the pop-up menu for the test with focus.
</p>


<center>
<img src="../../images/popupMenu.gif" border="0"  alt="Test Tree popup menu" longdesc="popupmenu.html">
</center>

<p>The pop-up menu contains the following menu items:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Execute these tests</b> - See <a href="#popupMenu.execute">Quick
  Pick Test Execution</a> for a detailed description.</li>
<li><b>Refresh</b> - See <a href="#popupMenu.refresh">Refresh
  Test Suite Contents</a> for a detailed description.</li>
<li><b>Clear Results</b> - See <a href="#popupMenu.clear">Clear
  Previous Test Results</a> for a detailed description.</li>
<!--insert:ConfigureTest-->
</ul>

<p>
The harness does not allow you to perform operations using the pop-up menu when
it is running tests. The  harness displays an error dialog box if you
attempt to perform an operation using the pop-up menu when tests are running.</p>
<p>
See <a href="../ui/keyboardAccess.html">Keyboard access</a> for a description
of how you can use the keyboard  to open and navigate the pop-up menu.
</p>
<a name="popupMenu.execute"><!--index:menu: test tree pop-up: execute -->
  <!-- index:Quick Pick test execution: test tree pop-up menu --></a>
<h2>Quick Pick Test Execution</h2>
<p>You can use the Execute these tests menu item to run the tests and folders highlighted in the test tree, subject to filters such as keywords.</p>
<p>
The  harness does not automatically perform a refresh operation before
  running the tests. If changes are made to a test suite, you must perform a
  refresh before running tests. See <a href="#popupMenu.refresh">Refresh Test
  Suite Contents</a> for
  a description of the refresh operation.</p>
<h3 class="proc">
Quick Pick Test Execution of Specific Folders or Tests</h3>

<ul><li>You must left click
      to select nodes. When more than one folder or test is highlighted in the

Selecting a test executes only that test.</li>

</ol>
<blockquote>
  <p> Opening the pop-up menu is a platform-specific operation (such as right
        clicking in the test tree pane).  A modifier key or operation which
        doesn't utilize the clicking at all may be necessary depending on your
        platform details.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="3"><li>
    Choose Execute these tests from the test tree pop-up menu. </li></ol>
<blockquote>

    <ul>
    <li>If the Test Manager contains a completed configuration, the harness displays
    a message to confirm the execute operation.</li>
    <li>If the Test Manager does not contain a completed configuration, the harness

</ul>  

  <p class="note">
    <!--CopyOff--><IMG SRC="../../images/hg_note.gif" ALT="The following text is a note"><br><!--CopyOn-->
  The harness combines the <a href="currentConfiguration.html">current configuration</a> and the nodes selected in the test tree  to determine which
  tests will be executed. In the <a href="testManager.html">Test Manager Preferences</a>,
  the option &quot;Execution from tree popup includes configuration Tests to Run&quot; how the harness uses the 
  Tests to Run value in the configuration, as described below:
  
  <a name="popupMenu.execute"><!--index:menu: test tree pop-up: override current configuration  --></a>

  </p>

  <P><b>Box is unchecked (default).</b> The harness ignores the tests specified in   the <a href="currentConfiguration.html"> current configuration</a>'s Tests to Run question. It runs the tests selected in   the test tree, subject to configuration Test Selection filters, such as   keywords. This option is compatible with the behavior of test harnesses   older than version 4.2.1.  </P>
  <P><b>Box is checked.</b> The harness compares the tests  you selected in the test tree and  the tests specified in the configuration's Tests to Run question to find a set of common tests. The harness then applies the configuration's Test Selection   filters (such as keywords) to the common test set, producing the set of eligible tests.</P>
    
</blockquote>

<ol start="4">
  <li>
    Tests will be executed. The above test selection process and exclusions from the criteria
   defined by the test suite or interview may eliminate all the
   eligible tests. If this happens you will see a message, and the test  run is aborted.</li>

</ol>

<a name="popupMenu.refresh"><!--index:menu: test tree pop-up: refresh test suite contents -->
  <!-- index:Refresh Test Suite Contents: test tree pop-up menu --></a>

<h2>Refresh Test Suite Contents</h2>

<p>
When developing tests, changes in a test suite are not automatically detected
  by the  harness. The first time tests are run, the harness
uses the test finder to read test descriptions.  If the harness loads tests
from an existing work directory, the test descriptions contained in those
results are used by default.</p>
<p>
The refresh operation enables test developers<a name="testManager.filter"> </a> to load changes they might have
made in a test suite without restarting the  harness or reloading the
test suite.</p>
<p>
The  harness does not require a work directory to perform a refresh of
  the test suite.</p>
<p>
If you are viewing the test panel after refreshing a test or folder, update the
  test tree by choosing a different test or folder icon and repeating your test
  tree choice.</p>

<h3 class="proc">Refresh Tests and Folders</h3>

  <li>Select one or more folders and tests in the test tree.</li></ol>

      the test tree, the Test Manager displays a list of the selected tests and
      folders in the information area.</li>

    <li> Selecting a folder chooses all tests currently known to the Test Manager
      in and below that folder.</li></ul></blockquote>

You can use the Clear Results menu item to remove existing test results for any
  combination of tests and folders.</p>

To clear test results, you must have an open work directory.
