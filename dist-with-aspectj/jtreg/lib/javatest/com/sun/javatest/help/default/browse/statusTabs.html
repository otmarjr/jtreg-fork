<h1>Status Information</h1>
<p>In addition to Summary and Documentation information, the folder view contains five status tabs that use the view filter to group and list a folder's tests by their results in the work directory. See
  <a href="folderInfo.html">Displaying Folder Information</a> for additional information.
</p>
<ul>
<li type="disc"><p>In the tabbed panes, click a test in the list to display the summary message at the bottom of the pane.</p></li>
<li type="disc"><p>By default the list has two columns, Name and Title. Click a heading to sort the list.
<li type="disc"><p>To display alternate information in the second column, right-click on the column heading and make a selection from the Description or Runtime context menus.<br>

  the names of tests in the selected folder whose results are filtered out by
  the selected view filter.

<p>
The second column contains a specific reason why the test result is filtered out by the view filter. The specific reason depends on the view filter criteria. See <a href="viewFilters.html">View Filters</a> for a detailed description of filtering criteria.
