<H1><A name="example3">Doing Escapes in a UNIX System Shell</A></H1>
<P>The following example uses the syntax for doing escapes in a UNIX system shell. Changes to the original configuration file (<EM>myoriginal</EM><CODE>.jti</CODE> in this example) are written to a new  configuration file (<EM>my-newconfig</EM><CODE>.jti</CODE> in this example).</P>
<P>In the following example, <EM>myoriginal</EM><CODE>.jti</CODE> represents a configuration file name that might exist on your system. Win32 users must also replace the UNIX system file separators (\) with Windows file separators (/) to run these examples.</P>
<P>To change a value in the command line, use the <I>tag-name</I> for the question that sets the value. See <a href="tagName.html">Obtaining the Question tag-name</A> for detailed information about viewing the <I>tag-name</I> for the question.</P>
