<P>When starting the harness, include <CODE>-newDesktop</CODE> in the command string to start the harness GUI without using a previous desktop. The harness ignores any previous desktop information and opens the  Quick Start wizard.</P>
<p><b>Note:&nbsp;</b> Some test suites do not implement the optional Quick&nbsp;Start wizard. It won't be available if the test suite architect disabled it.</p>
<P class="note"><!--CopyOff--><IMG src="../../images/hg_note.gif" alt="The following text is a note" longdesc="newDesktop.html"><BR><!--CopyOn-->
The harness uses a new desktop when you include GUI options in the command
line. Using this option preserves any preferences set for the desktop. Use the
following example to start the harness with a new Desktop.</P>
