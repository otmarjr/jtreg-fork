<h1>Current Configuration View Filter</h1>

<p>
When you select the Current Configuration view filter, the Test Manager only displays the status of the folders and tests currently selected by the current configuration.
</p>

<p>
To select the Current Configuration view filter, choose View &gt; Filter &gt; Current Configuration from the menu bar or choose the Current Configuration view filter from the tool bar.</p>
<p>The following examples provide descriptions of the use of the Current Configuration
  view filter:</p>
<ul>
  <li>    <b>
    Example 1 -</b> You only want to run and view the results for
      tests in the <code>api</code> folder. See <a href="../confEdit/initialFiles.html">Specifying
      Tests to Run</a> for detailed description of specifying the tests that
  are run.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    Either choose View &gt; Filter &gt; Current Configuration from the menu bar or choose the Current Configuration view filter from the tool bar.
  </p>
  <p>
  The Test Manager displays gray <IMG SRC="../../images/grayFolder.gif" ALT="Filtered out folder"  longdesc="folderIcons.html"> folder
  and <IMG SRC="../../images/grayTest.gif" ALT="Test Filtered Out" longdesc="testIcons.html"> test
  icons for all folders and tests except those under <code>api</code>. The Test Manager changes the Summary totals to indicate that these tests are
  filtered out. </p>
  <p> The current result icons are only displayed in the test tree for those
  folder and test icons under <code>api</code> and the Summary pane is updated
  to display their totals. When you run the tests, the test tree and folder view
  only display the results for those folders and tests under <code>api</code>.  </p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
  <li>    <b>
    Example 2
- </b>You only want to run and view results for failed tests. See <a href="../confEdit/status.html">Specifying Prior Status</a> for a detailed description of setting the prior status value.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
  <p> Either choose View &gt; Filters &gt; Current Configuration from the menu
    bar or choose the Current Configuration view filter from the tool bar. </p>
  <p>
  Immediately the Test Manager displays gray <IMG SRC="../../images/grayFolder.gif" ALT="Filtered out folder"  longdesc="folderIcons.html"> folder
  and <IMG SRC="../../images/grayTest.gif" ALT="Test Filtered Out" longdesc="testIcons.html"> test
  icons for all folders and tests except those with Failed test results. The
  Test Manager updates the Summary totals to indicate that these tests
  are filtered out and changes the Passed, Error, and Not Run totals to indicate
  0. </p>
  <p> The Test Manager displays those folders and tests in the test tree
    with Failed test results as red <IMG SRC="../../images/redFolder.gif" ALT="Failed folder" longdesc="folderIcons.html"> folder and <IMG SRC="../../images/redTest.gif" ALT="Test Failed" longdesc="testIcons.html"> test icons. The Test Manager updates the Summary information to indicate the number of tests that have Failed test results.
  </p>
  <p>
  When you repeat the test run, as failed tests pass, the Test Manager updates their icons from red <IMG SRC="../../images/redFolder.gif" ALT="Failed folder" longdesc="folderIcons.html"> folder and <IMG SRC="../../images/redTest.gif" ALT="Test Failed" longdesc="testIcons.html"> test icons to gray <IMG SRC="../../images/grayFolder.gif" ALT="Filtered out folder"  longdesc="folderIcons.html"> folder and <IMG SRC="../../images/grayTest.gif" ALT="Test Filtered Out" longdesc="testIcons.html"> test icons (they no longer match the configuration criteria of the view filter). The Test Manager updates the totals in the Summary pane to match the results displayed in the test tree.
  </p>
