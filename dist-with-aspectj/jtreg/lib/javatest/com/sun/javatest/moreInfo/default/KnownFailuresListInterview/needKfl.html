<body>
<p>A <em>known failures list</em> (KFL) is a file that contains a list of
tests in a test suite that are known to fail for some
reason.  The list contains path names that uniquely
identify test names and test cases.  The information is currently utilized
to generate information in test reports.</p>
<p>
Known failure list files conventionally use the extension <code>.kfl</code> and
are kept either as a user's personal file or a shared file, but not generally
distributed as part of a test suite (unlike an exclude list).</p>
