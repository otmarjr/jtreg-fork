<body>
To prevent a stalled test from stopping a test run, most
test suites use a timeout limit. The timeout limit is the
length of time that the harness must wait for a test to complete
before beginning the next test. 
<p>
If you run tests on a slow CPU or a slow network, you can increase 
the time limit by specifying a floating point value in the time factor 
field. Each test's timeout limit is multiplied by the time factor 
value. The default range of values used by 
the harness is from 0.1 to 100.</p>
<p>
Note: Use the floating point format specific to your locale.
</p>
<p>
For example, if your locale uses floating point values in the form of "x.x" and you specify a value of "2.0", the timeout limit for tests with a 10 minute limit becomes 20 minutes. A value of "0.5" for tests with a 10 minute limit produces a 5 minute timeout limit.
</p>
<p>
If your locale uses floating point values in the form of "x,x", you would specify a values of "2,0" and "0,5" for the example.
</p>
<p>
At first, use the default value of "1" to run tests and then, if necessary,
increase the value.
