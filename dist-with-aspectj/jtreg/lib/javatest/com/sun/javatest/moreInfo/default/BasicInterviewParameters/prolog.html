<body>
The JT Harness Configuration Editor interviews you about the
parameters used to run your tests.  Test parameters are values
that determine which tests in the test suite are run and
how they are run.  The interview contains between 10 and 14
questions.
<p>
The harness saves your parameter settings in the work
directory so that they can be used with subsequent test
runs.  You can save your answers at any time using the
commands in the File menu.

few times you use the editor; it contains important
information and examples about each question.
