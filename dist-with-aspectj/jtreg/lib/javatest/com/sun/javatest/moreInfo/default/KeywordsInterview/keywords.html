<body>
Use this field to restrict the set of tests to be run
based on keywords associated with tests in the test suite.
<p>
In the text field, construct a boolean expression, built up
from keywords and the operators "&#38" (and), "!" (not), "|" (or), and
"( )" (parentheses for grouping).  Keywords stand as
boolean predicates that are true if, and only if, the
keyword is present in the test being considered.  A test is
accepted if the overall value of the expression is true;
all other tests are rejected by the restriction.
</p>
<p>
Examples:
</p>
<p>
Imagine a fictional test suite that uses the keyword "interactive"
to identify tests that require human interaction, and uses
"color" to identify tests that require a color display:
</p>

<p>
Enter the following expression to only execute tests with
the "interactive" keyword:
</p>
<table width="300" border="1" cellpadding="2">
<tr>
<td>
<code>interactive</code>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
Enter the following expression to only execute tests with
both the "interactive" and "color" keywords:
</p>
<table width="300" border="1" cellpadding="2">
<tr>
<td>
<code>color&#38interactive</code>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
Enter the following expression to only execute tests with
the "color" keyword that do not also contain
the "interactive" keyword.
</p>
<table width="300" border="1" cellpadding="2">
<tr>
<td>
<code>color&#38!interactive</code>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
