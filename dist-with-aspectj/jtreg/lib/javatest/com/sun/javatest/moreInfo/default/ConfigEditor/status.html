You can include or exclude tests from a test run based on their
status from a previous test run. It is often useful to choose all of
the status values except "passed" for the first few test runs, then
refine the filtering to reduce the number of tests in subsequent
runs.
<p>
Note that you can choose <i>Error</i> to select any test that the
harness could not execute the last time it was included in a
test run. These errors usually occur because the test environment is
not properly configured.
