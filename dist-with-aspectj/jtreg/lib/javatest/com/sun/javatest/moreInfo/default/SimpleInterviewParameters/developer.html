Developer mode has been specified for this interview by 
invoking the harness using the following command-line
option:
<dl class="menupath">
<dd class="menupath"><code>-DSimpleInterviewParameters.mode=developer</code>
</dl>
<p>
This causes the tests to be compiled and executed when the test suite is run.
</p>
<p>
To compile the tests, you must also set <code>command.compile.java</code>
system property using a command-line option.  See the "Compiling Test Suites"
appendix in the <i>JT Harness Architect's Guide</i> for details.
