The harness can run tests concurrently. If you are running
the tests on a multi-processor computer, concurrency can speed up
your test runs.  For your first test run you should leave this field
set to "1". After you have the tests running properly you can
experiment with this value.
<p>
To prevent a stalled test from stopping a test run, most test suites
use a timeout limit. The timeout limit is the amount of time that the
harness waits for a test to complete before moving on to the
next test.  Each test's timeout limit is multiplied by the time
factor value. For example, if you specify a value of "2", the timeout
limit for tests with a 10 minute limit becomes 20 minutes. Try
running with a time factor of "1.0" and increase the value as
necessary.
