<body>
An <em>exclude list</em> is a file that contains a list of
tests in a test suite that should not be run for some
reason.  The list contains path names that uniquely
identify tests to be excluded.  When the harness prepares to
run a test, it checks to see if the test is on the exclude
list, if it is, the test is ignored during the test run.
<p>
Exclude list files conventionally use the extension <code>.jtx</code>
and may be supplied with a test suite or downloaded from a web site.
