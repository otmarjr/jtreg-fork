Depending on your test suite, there are a number of ways that you can
specify an exclude list to use for your test runs.  Depending on how
the test suite is configured, you may see or more of the
following choices:

<table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="5">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="20%">
Initial
</td>
<td>
If your test suite displays this option and you choose to use it, the harness uses the exclude list shipped with your test suite. Although
this list is accurate when the test suite is created, over time the
list may become out-of-date. If the list is out-of-date you must use
one of the other choices to specify an up-to-date list.
</td>
</tr>

<tr valign="top">
<td>
Latest
</td>
<td>
If your test suite displays this option and you choose to use it, the harness downloads the latest exclude list from a web site specified by your test suite. The harness periodically checks the web site for the latest exclude list.
</td>

<tr valign="top">
