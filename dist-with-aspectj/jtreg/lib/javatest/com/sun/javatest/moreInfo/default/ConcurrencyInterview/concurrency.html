<body>
The harness can run tests concurrently. If you are running the
tests on a multi-processor computer, concurrency can speed
up your test runs.  The default range of values used by 
the JT Harness harness is from 1 to 50.
<p>
For your first test run you should leave this field set to "1". After
you have the tests running properly you can experiment with this
value. Unless your test suite restricts concurrency, the maximum
<em>number</em> of threads specified by the <code>concurrency</code>
command is 50. See your test suite documentation for additional
information about using concurrency values greater than 1.
