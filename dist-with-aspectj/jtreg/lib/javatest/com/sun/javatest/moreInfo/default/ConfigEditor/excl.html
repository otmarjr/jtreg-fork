An exclude list is a file that contains a list of tests in a test suite that for some reason should not be run. The list contains path names that uniquely identify tests to be excluded. When the harness prepares to run a test, it checks to see if the test is on the exclude list, if it is, the test is ignored during the test run.
<p>
There are a number of ways that you can
specify an exclude list to use for your test runs.  See your test suite
documentation for the correct method for your test suite.
