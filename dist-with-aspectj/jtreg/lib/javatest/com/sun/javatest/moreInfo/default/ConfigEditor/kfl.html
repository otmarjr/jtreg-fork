A <i>known failures list</i> (KFL) is a user-authored text file with the extension <code>.kfl</code>. The file lists tests in a test suite that are known to fail. The failing tests are identified by path names that uniquely identify test names and test cases. Known failures list files are maintained by users (they are not distributed as part of a test suite, unlike an exclude list). Currently the known failures information is used to generate and filter information in test reports. See the help topic "KFL Options in HTML Reports" for more information on creating and using a known failures list.
</p>
<p>To specify one or more KFL filters, choose the Select Files radio button.</p>
<p>Click Add to open a file chooser dialog. Locate your list and click Select. You can continue to add filters, using the Move buttons to organize them as you see fit. Note, the order of the files displayed does not have any effect on the report outcome.</p>
<p>Click Done when you are finished.</p>
